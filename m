O.K, so that will never be accepted. There is support for zero copy in
sockets. Look at the work Eric did. And you should look at netlink,
which might be needed for the control plane.

Having the services running in kernel space is going to limit what
services you can actually offer, if you need to go through getting
them merged every time. If you only have one or two, yes it can be
done. But anything general purpose is not going to be practical.  The
answer might be to write your services using eBPF. They can then be
loaded from user space and do pretty much anything which eBPF can do.

There is often a huge step from academic code to production
code. Academic code just needs to implement enough to prove the
concept. It can take all sort of short cuts. Production code to be
merged into the kernel needs to follow the usual development
processes, code quality guidelines, and most importantly,
architecture.

If you want to make that step to production code, we can help you, but
i don't think it makes any sense to merge API code until you have the
correct basic architecture. That architecture will define what APIs
you need, and sitting on top of sockets might not be correct.
