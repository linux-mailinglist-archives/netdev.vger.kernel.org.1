As a submitter you propose changes and silence is acknowledgement. If 
one of your API changes broke someone's driver and they did not notify 
you of the breakage during the review cycle, it falls on their shoulder 
to fix it for themselves and they should not be holding back your work, 
that would not be fair. If you know about the breakage, and there is 
still no fix, that is an indication the driver is not actively used and 
maintained.

This also does not mean you have to do the entire API changes to a 
driver you do not know about on your own. Nothing ever prevents you from 
posting the patches as RFC and say: "here is how I would go about 
changing your driver, please review and help me make corrections". If 
the driver maintainers do not respond there is no reason their lack of 
involvement should refrain your work, and so your proposed changes will 
be merged eventually.

Is not this the whole point of being a community and be able to delegate 
and mitigate the risk of large scale changes?

I cannot show you an example because we never had to go that far and I 
did not say that this is an established practice, but that we *could* do 
that if we ever reached that point.

Even if Alex and his firmware colleague end up being the only two people 
using this driver if the decision is to make it upstream because this is 
the desired distribution and development model of the driver we should 
respect that.

And just to be clear, we should not be respecting that because Meta, or 
Alex or anyone decided that they were doing the world a favor by working 
in the open rather than being closed door, but simply because we cannot 
*presume* about their intentions and the future.

For drivers specifically, yes, there is a question of to which degree 
can we scale horizontally, and I do not think there is ever going to be 
an answer to that, as we will continue to see new drivers emerge, 
possibly with few users, for some definition of few.
