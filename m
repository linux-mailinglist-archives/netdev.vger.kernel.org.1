There is only one system priority in the bond, which means all aggregators
share the same system priority â€” right?

Or do you mean we should also take the partner's system priority into account?

Same question, the system priority and aggregator MAC address are all same
in the same bonding interface. So how can we prioritize between two
aggregators within the same bond?

Unless we take the partner's System ID into account. Which looks like, if
we want to choose a better aggregator in bond, we need to config the switch side...

Can we active a aggregator that don't have LACP partner? If not, then
we don't need to compare that aggregator.

Yes
