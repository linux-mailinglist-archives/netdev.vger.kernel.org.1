My current implementation represents the devices as following
in '/sys/class/ism':

ism_lo -> ../../devices/virtual/ism/ism_lo
lismvpci0 -> ../../devices/pci0124:00/0124:00:00.0/ism/ismvpci0

The driver is repsonsible for the naming of its devices.

And yes, because the s390 ism_vpci is backed by a PCI device,
'/sys/class/ism/ismvpci0/device/enable' exists.

I think we could implement a device attribute for ism_lo
to implement this functionality. I already have a=20
device attribute implemented in ism_main
to access the gid of each ISM device. This leads
to the following sysfs entries:

'/sys/class/ism/ism_lo/gid'
'/sys/class/ism/ismvpci0/gid'
