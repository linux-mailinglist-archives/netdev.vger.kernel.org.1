Well in our case there isn't an eswitch. The issue is more the logic
for the Ethernet PHY isn't setup to only run one port. Instead the PHY
is MUXed over 2 ports per interface, and then the QSFP interface
itself is spread over 4 ports.

What you end up with is something like the second to last image in
this article[1] where you have a MAC/PCS pair per host sitting on top
of one PMA with some blocks that are shared between the hosts and some
that are not. The issue becomes management of access to the QSFP and
PHY and how to prevent one host from being able to monopolize the
PHY/QSFP or crash the others if something goes sideways. Then you have
to also add in the BMC management on top of that.
