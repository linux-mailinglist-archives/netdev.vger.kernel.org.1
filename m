No, I get your message. I wasn't saying it was your problem. All that
can be asked for is such cooperation. Like I said I think some of the
problem was the messaging more than the process.

Oh, I know. I resisted the urge to push out the driver as "idgaf:
Internal Device Generated at Facebook" on April 1st instead of "fbnic"
to poke fun at the presentation they did at Netdev 0x16 where they
were trying to say all the vendors should be implementing "idpf" since
they made it a standard.

It all depends on your definition of being extractive. I would assume
a "consumer" that is running a large number of systems and is capable
of providing sophisticated feedback on issues found within the kernel,
in many cases providing fixes for said issues, or working with
maintainers on resolution of said issues, is not extractive.

The fact that said "consumer" decides to then produce their own device
becoming a "prosumer" means they are now able to more accurately and
quickly diagnose issues when they see them. They can design things
such that there isn't some black box of firmware, or a third party
driver, in the datapath that prevents them from quickly diagnosing the
issue. So if anything I would think that is a net positive for the
community as it allows the "prosumer" to provide much more quick and
useful feedback on issues found in the kernel rather than having to
wait on a third party vendor to provide additional input.

Note I am not going after any particular vendor with my comments. This
applies to all vendors. The problem as a customer is that you are
limited on what you can do once you find an issue. Quite often you are
at the mercy of the vendor in such cases, especially when there seems
to be either firmware or "security" issues involved.

Thanks,
