I would say ignoring the rule about an API always having a user has
led to badly designed code, which is actually going to lead to bugs.

It is clearly a philosophical point, what the base of the type is, and
what are helpers. For me, the base is a i64 representing nano seconds,
operations too add, subtract and compare, and a way to get the number
of nanoseconds in and out.

I see being able to create such a type from microseconds, millisecond,
seconds and decades as helpers on top of this base. Also, being able
to extract the number of nanoseconds from the type but expressed in
microseconds, milliseconds, seconds and months are lossy helpers on
top of the base.

So far, we only have one use case for this type, holding a duration to
be passed to fsleep(). Rounding down what you pass to fsleep() is
generally not what the user wants to do, and we should try to design
the code to avoid this. The current helpers actually encourage such
bugs, because they round down. Because of this they are currently
unused. But they are a trap waiting for somebody to fall into. What
the current users of this type really want is lossy helpers which
round up. And by reviewing the one user against the API, it is clear
the current API is wrong.

So i say, throw away the round down helpers until somebody really
needs them. That avoids a class of bugs, passing a too low value to
sleep. Add the one helper which is actually needed right now.

There is potentially a better option. Make the actual sleep operation
part of the type. All the rounding up then becomes part of the core,
and the developer gets core code which just works correctly, with an
API which is hard to make do the wrong thing.
