Hi,

the short or the long answer?
The short answer "yes, but no".
Also your router may not even know your wan ip either (in case of CG-NAT).

The long anser:
It is quite complicated as there are way too many "standards" for this 
and none of them is universal. Basically you'd have to try a bunch of 
different approaches and somehow also figure out what to do with 
conflicting information. I'll provide them as a kind of list as maybe 
one of them alone (without having a truely universal algorithm for it) 
may be enough. Further I'm going to assume you mean for IPv4 as in an 
IPv6 network you'd already have your GUA(s) on your interface (well, or 
at least on a interface, not necessarily the upstream one but anyway 
thats a different topic).

allow some hosts to use public IPs and may (without mentioning how) 
advertise information (like the public IP) from the public link to them.
* [RFC 5597 "NAT DCCP Requirements" Section 1: "Also, a separate,

allocation needs to be refreshed/renewed" but it doesn't mention how to 
do this.

But if you're asking for advice on how to handle this I'd say:
1. Try to go IPv6-first and/or IPv6-mostly, just way less headach and 
better performance.
2. Where not possible either go the kinda radical way and use tor or i2p 
as an overlay and have them deal with nat traversal or if that is 
undesirable use something like libp2p or a webrtc library.
3. If all of that doesn't work try to connect to and proxy through a 
TURN server.
4. If that also doesn't work try to connect to a HTTP(S) proxy that 
supports HTTP-CONNECT tunnel
5. (no experience so far, but is newer and could work in some 
environments) the *-over-QUIC RFCs (RFC 9250, RFC 9221, RFC 9000, RFC 
9220, RFC 9484, RFC 9298, RFC 9297, and ongoing drafts: 
https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/masque/documents/)

Tbh I personally when neither going IPv6-only or working around the v4 
NAT with e.g. a VPN isn't an option would just use tor, i2p, libp2p, or 
Yggdrasil as my overlay and let them deal with the hard parts. Basically 
I'd use e.g. the Tor Projects Arti project as my transport layer 
https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti Tor and i2p have the added 
benefit of being fully End-to-End encrypted and the endpoint addresses 
being unambiguous and cryptographically ensured.

Also just a note if you're leaving the SOHO and SMB environments and 
also having to deal with enterprise networks then you basically don't 
have any way to autodetect this as there are ofte multiple (literally 
countless) nats to different public IPs depending on destination, 
protocol, or even network saturation. You basically have to let the 
admin/user provide one manually.
(And side note, I also have already used it to link stuff together 
without a centralized public server)


Sincerely,
Klaus Frank
