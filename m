And to be clear, something we totally ignore in many places in the
kernel because it flat out does not matter at all.

Think about userspace writing 2 different values to the same sysfs file
at the same time, which the kernel driver will then attempt to save into
the same location at the "same" time.  Which one wins?  Who cares?
Userspace did something foolish and it doesn't matter, and writes are
pretty much "atomic" in that they do not split across memory locations
so it's not a real issue.

Same here with your "speed" value, it just doesn't matter, right?  One
will "win" and the other one will not, so what is the problem?  Same
thing would happen if you put a lock here, but a lock would be
pointless.

So yes, I agree, mark things in rust as "mut" if you are going to change
them, that's good, but attempting to prevent multiple writes at the same
time without a lock, that's not going to matter, if it did, you would
have used a lock :)
