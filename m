Yikes. I totally missed that.

Ohhhh, I saw the pinctrl-gmii explanation before, but I didn't understand it.
I get it now. Sorry.

I think that as long as the delays aren't added by the other end
("PHY"), then phy-mode = "rgmii" would be the adequate mode to describe
this (even if it only has an informative purpose).

The delays, even if added by the local system, are added externally to
the MAC block (given its current bindings). Similar in that regard to
PCB delays. Which makes the device tree basically correct/consistent in
that particular aspect.

It helped a lot, thank you for clarifying.

I'm not sure that making changes there would become necessary.

Which is what it should be, IMO.
