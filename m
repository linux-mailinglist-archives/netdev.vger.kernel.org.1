So it seems.

I think the sentence just intended to clarify what it means for the port
to be non-filtering, but in the process introduced the ambiguity of
whether VLANs should be committed to hardware tables or not.

To be clear, from the bridge perspective, VLAN filtering = VLAN awareness
(there doesn't exist any option to, say, have per-VLAN learning but not
filtering). I suppose that if the hardware supports mechanisms of being
VLAN-aware but not filtering, and still do VLAN-unaware learning, those
mechanisms can be used as long as the bridging layer expectations are met.

You can add restrictions for these cases for 'net', as I don't think any
current DSA driver handles this correctly. Then, if you want to take a
stab at offloading these configurations, feel free to do so in net-next.

Keep in mind that we haven't experimented with dynamically unoffloading
a bridge port before (calling switchdev_bridge_port_unoffload() at
runtime). That will be necessary when toggling the bridge vlan_filtering
option. It should work, but I can't guarantee that it does. In general,
software bridging was retrofitted onto DSA drivers which also support
bridge offload, and not all of them may work correctly (they may still
have address learning enabled, things like that). I'd only consider that
path as suitable for net-next.

The first option suggests that you can implement a VLAN-unaware bridge
by mapping the entire 4K VLAN space to a single VLAN within the hardware
switch. It has to be configured specially at the driver level, to always
preserve the VLAN tag (and ID) when egressing the packet. Then exempt
certain VLAN IDs (of 8021q uppers) from this treatment, and include only
the user port and CPU port in their forwarding mask.

The above can also be reinterpreted in the key that packets with a VLAN
ID that isn't in the VLAN database aren't "filtered" but forwarded as-is,
and learned all together. It seems to be similar with your own
suggestion above.

It's just an idea, and requires hardware support to achieve that. This
circles back to the idea that the port can be configured as VLAN "aware"
as long as it's not "filtering" from the bridge perspective, and there
is no address space segregation per VLAN in the FDB. The bridge doesn't
need to be aware of this custom mode of operation, the driver may decide
to transition to it only in the presence of 8021q uppers on top of
VLAN-unaware bridge ports.
