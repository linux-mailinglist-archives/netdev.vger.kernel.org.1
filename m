Can you be more precise? What does "the situation" refer to? Are you
saying that the latency decrease is larger than 162x as the number
of sockets increases? 

It would be helpful to include that data in the cover letter showing
the latency differences amongst various socket counts.

Why is it not OK? I assume because there is too much latency? If
so... the data for that configuration should be provided so it can
be examined and compared.

Sure; it's a trade off between CPU cycles and latency, right? I
think that data should be provided so that it is more clear what the
actual trade-off is; how many cycles am I trading for the latency
reduction at p90+ ?

It's not clear from the cover letter that this is what the base case
is testing. I am not doubting that you are testing this; I'm
commenting that the cover letter does not clearly explain this
because I also didn't follow that.

This detail would be useful to explain in the cover letter; it was
not clear to me why busy_read would be used, as you'll see in my
response.

If onload spins in userspace, wouldn't a test case of running
userspace on one core so it can spin and doing NAPI processing on
another core be a good test case to include in the data?

Two comments here:

1. If it was the base case which motivated the work, should an
explanation of this and data about it be provided so it can be
examined?

2. If PPS is low, wouldn't you _want_ the core to go idle?

Respectfully, I disagree.

I think the cover letter lacks a significant amount of detail, test
data, and test setup information which makes reproducing the results
a lot more work for a reviewer.

Respectfully, I don't agree that the improvements are "apparent." I
think my comments and Martin's comments both suggest that the cover
letter does not make the improvements apparent.

I'm not missing that part; I'll let Martin speak for himself but I
suspect he also follows that part.

If some one were missing that part, though, it'd probably suggest a
more thorough approach to documenting the change in the cover
letter, right?

Why not provide the numbers for this and many other test cases (as
mentioned above) so that this can be evaluated more clearly?

I think the point Martin makes here is subtle, but extremely
important.

Introducing a general purpose mechanism to burn cores at 100% CPU,
potentially doing nothing if network traffic is very low, should not
be taken lightly and, IMHO, very rigorous data should be provided so
that anyone who decides to turn this on knows what trade-off is.

As it stands presently, it's not clear to me how many CPU cycles I
am trading to get the claim of a 162X latency improvement at the
tail (which, like Martin, is a claim I find quite odd and worth
investigating in and of itself as to _why_ it is so large).
