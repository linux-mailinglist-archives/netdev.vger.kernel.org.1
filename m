Please update the text. As far as i see, a lot of this is not relevant
for this patch set. phy_package_join() etc has no relation to DT,
since the driver knows how many devices are in its package, it knows
its base address, etc.

The DT is only about properties which are shared by all PHYs within
the package, e.g reset, regulators, maybe the MODE_CFG register for
this particular PHY package.

This needs a compatible for this particular PHY package.

This property it not useful. Why PCA does it apply to, when there are
two? It makes much more sense to describe the overall configuration
mode, from which you can derive what interface mode each port should
be using, and thus validate the phy-mode in DT.
