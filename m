Depends what the driver wants to do.

From the subset of drivers that implement WoL and use phylib:

drivers/net/ethernet/socionext/sni_ave.c:
	ave_init()
	ave_suspend() - to save the wolopts from the PHY
	ave_resume() - to restore them to the PHY - so presumably
		working around a buggy PHY driver, but no idea which
		PHY driver because although it uses DT, there's no way
		to know from DT which PHYs get used on this platform.

drivers/net/ethernet/ti/cpsw_ethtool.c:
	does nothing more than forwarding the set_wol()/get_wol()
	ethtool calls to phylib.

drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/enetc/enetc_ethtool.c:
	enetc_set_wol() merely sets the device for wakeup as appropriate
	based on the wolopts after passing it to phylib.

drivers/net/ethernet/microchip/lan743x_ethtool.c:
	lan743x_ethtool_set_wol() tracks the wolopts *before* passing
	to phylib, and enables the device for wakeup as appropriate.
	The whole:
	"return netdev->phydev ? phy_ethtool_set_wol(netdev->phydev, wol)
                        : -ENETDOWN;"
	thing at the end is buggy. You're updating the adapters state
	and the device wakeup enable, _then_ checking whether we have a
	phydev. If we don't have a phydev, you're then telling userspace
	that the request to change the WoL settings failed but you've
	already changed your configuration!

	Moreover, looking at lan743x_ethtool_get_wol(), you set
	WAKE_MAGIC | WAKE_PHY irrespective of what the PHY actually
	supports. This makes a total nonsense of the purpose of the
	supported flags here.

	I guess the _reason_ you do this is because the PHY may not be
	present (because you look it up in the .ndo_open() method) and
	thus you're trying to work around that... but then set_wol()
	fails in that instance. This all seems crazy.

	Broadcom bcmgenet also connects to the PHY in .ndo_open() and
	has sane semantics for .get_wol/.set_wol. I'd suggest having
	a look at that driver...

drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/genet/bcmgenet_wol.c:
	bcmgenet_set_wol() saves the value of wolopts in its
	private data structure and bcmgenet_wol_power_down_cfg()/
	bcmgenet_wol_power_up_cfg() uses this to decide what to
	power down/up.

Now, let's look at what ethtool already does for us when attempting
a set_wol() peration.

1. It retrieves the current WoL configuration from the netdev into
   'wol'.
2. It modifies wol.wolopts according to the users request.
3. It validates that the options set in wol.wolopts do _not_ include
   anything that is not reported as supported (in other words, no
   bits are set that aren't in wol.supported.)
4. It deals with the WoL SecureOnâ„¢ password.
5. It calls the netdev to set the new configuration.
6. If successful, it updates the netdev's flag which indicates whether
   WoL is currently enabled _in some form_ for this netdev.

Ergo, network device drivers are *not* supposed to report modes in
wol.supported that they do not support, and thus a network driver
can be assured that wol.wolopts will not contain any modes that are
not supported.

Therefore, if a network device wishes to track which WoL modes are
currently enabled, it can do this simply by:

1. calling phy_ethtool_set_wol(), and if that call is successful, then
2. save the value of wol.wolopts to its own private data structure to
   determine what it needs to do at suspend/resume.

This should be independent of which modes the PHY supports, because the
etwork driver should be using phy_ethtool_get_wol() to retrieve the
modes which the PHY supports, and then augmenting the wol.supported
mask with whatever additional modes the network driver supports
beyond that.

So, there is no real need for a network driver to query phylib for the
current configuration except possibly during probe or when connecting
to its PHY.
