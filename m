Either way is valid. It's just 2 different common styles and I picked 
the other way. The reason is to look different for a sequence vs. 
mapping:

- required:
  - ethernet-ports

- required:
    ethernet-ports

It's easy to miss the missing '-'.

Yes, 'oneOf' here is not a json-schema keyword, but a key under $defs 
because it is indented. 

'$defs' entries must be a schema/dict/mapping (json-schema/python/yaml 
terms).

Indentation being significant is not quirky. Languages choose either 
indentation or brackets of some form. YAML uses one and JSON uses the 
other.

It has little to do with YAML other than indentation is *very* 
significant in YAML. It's actually valid YAML. It's probably valid 
json-schema, but questionable use in terms of how $defs is typically 
used.

Anyways, I'm working on a fix for the meta-schema.
