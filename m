Then how does phylink_stop() end up calling .mac_link_down() ?

You're not addessing the issue I've already stated here.

If the link was up, and we *don't* call mac_link_down(), we then *can*
*not* call phylink_mac_initial_config(). It's as simple as that. The
MAC must see link down before being configured.

So, if the link was up, and we don't call mac_link_down() then we must
also *not* call phylink_mac_initial_config(). I've no idea what will
break with that change.

The problem I have is not the idea, but the implementation. You want
to change the phylink behaviour in a way that affects *all* existing
users. I don't want that because of the guarantees of that contract
I've previously stated that I've given to existing users.

As things currently stand, you have a currently unique new case, and
you're trying to force your solution on all users potentially breaking
them. I have no real issue with supporting the new case, but *not* at
the expense of regressing existing phylink users.

Yet, when I point out this, you seem to be dead against *not* affecting
other users. This is where the problem is, and where we fundamentally
disagree.
