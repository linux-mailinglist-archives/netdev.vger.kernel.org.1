I don’t have a clear picture of what the API should look like yet, but I
believe it’s possible to avoid DMA and IRQ. In fact, the current data
transfer API, ops->move_data() in include/linux/ism.h, already abstracts
away the DMA and IRQ details.

One thing we cannot hide, however, is whether the operation is zero-copy
or copy. This distinction is important because we can reuse the data at
different times in copy mode and zero-copy mode.
