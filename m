Essentially any Ethernet MAC driver that calls phy_connect() in their 
.probe() routine would be doing this. bgmac.c is one such example, most, 
if not all of the time it deals with fixed-link PHYs because it is the 
Ethernet controller used with integrated switches, though occasionally 
there might an external PHY connected to it. There are certainly more 
examples.

Quite likely, yes.

Unfortunately if you care about consistency or independence between the 
boot stages, you have to duplicate things a tiny bit, for the reasons I 
mentioned that while you might bring-up networking in u-boot, you may 
not in Linux, or vice versa.

It's all wonderful if you can come to an agreement as to what belongs to 
the boot loader configuration and what belongs to the OS configuration, 
but in practice there is quite a bit of overlap due to each one being 
somewhat independent. I don't think there is a hard and fast set of 
rules, because all of this is inherently PHY specific, but there should 
be some general consistency that applies, starting with LEDs. Best if 
you can just HW strap though...

OK, but unfortunately I don't see how you can avoid not making those 
changes in u-boot.
