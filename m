Well, that's unfortunate :)  Maybe step 0 is to remove the Intel
entry from MAINTAINERS for this driver.

I'm pretty PM-illiterate myself.  Based on
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/admin-guide/pm/sleep-states.rst?id=v6.12#n109,
I assume that when we resume after hibernate, devices are in the same
state as after a fresh boot, i.e., the state driver .probe() methods
see.

So I assume that some combination of dev_pm_ops methods must be able
to do basically the same as .probe() to get the device usable again
after it was completely powered off and back on.

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/driver-api/pm/devices.rst?id=v6.12#n506
mentions .freeze(), .thaw(), .restore(), etc, but the fact that few
drivers set those pointers and all the nice macros for setting pm ops
(SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS, NOIRQ_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS, etc) only take
suspend and resume functions makes me think most drivers must handle
hibernation in the same .suspend() and .resume() functions they use
for non-hibernate transitions.

Since all drivers have to cope with devices needing to be
reinitialized after hibernate, I would look around to see how other
drivers do it and see if you can do it similarly.

Sorry this is still really a non-answer.

Bjorn
