That's the problem. It's the hardware that you should've described, not the driver.

In short, you should've allowed the interrupts from the get-go, and you wouldn't
be in this situation now :-)

Again, it's not the driver but the hardware that you're describing.

As long as you are fixing the description of the hardware, even for all three,
I am personally even fine with breaking the ABI, because the hardware description
has been wrong for all that time.

Just don't send those as Fixes commits, but next time you upstream something you
must keep in mind that in bindings/dts you're describing hardware - the driver is
something that should not drive any decision in what you write in bindings.

We're humans, so stuff like this happens - I'm not saying that you shall not make
mistakes - but again please, for the next time, please please please keep in mind
what I just said :-)

Now the options are two:
  - Break the ABI; or
  - Allow 4 or 8 interrupts (not 5, not 6, not 7)

and that - not just on MT7988 but also on 81 and 86 in one go.

Not sure if the second one is feasible, and I'm considering the first option only
because of that; if the second option can be done, act like I never ever considered
the first.

Cheers,
Angelo
