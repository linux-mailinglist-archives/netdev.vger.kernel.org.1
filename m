OK another "unnecessary" old-timer storage/network story/disruption to =
your otherwise relevant discussions (thank the subject line). If you're =
too busy, just don't read it. =F0=9F=98=8A

Around 1985, Gene Amdahl founded a company called Andor. Its original =
purpose (as was with everything Gene did) was to build the smallest =
plug-compatible mainframe.  When it was designed, someone noted it had =
no physical room for the humongous "Bus and Tag" cables needed for =
peripherals, so Gene raised a bit more money and started a storage =
project too.

When the Loma Prieta earthquake happened in 1989, PG&E, the local =
utility, lost the datacenter containing all of the information needed to =
repair their utilities, so the service people had to do this from =
memory.  The Public Utilities Commission didn't find this terribly =
funny, so they said PG&E had to create a second datacenter out of the =
area immediately and have backups there within about 24 hours, shorter =
as time went on.  So, they shut down the primary site every night, =
dumped to tape, then drove it up to Sacramento where these were =
restored.  They named this CTAM for "Chevy Truck Access Method."

Somehow Gene and friends heard about this and, as they already had a =
processor, device simulation and devices, if they added some sort of =
networking interface, they could have a local unit and a remote unit =
doing this backup, eliminating the truck.  BTW the "front end" storage =
group all came from Memorex.  The "back end" group mostly from Amdahl.

This actually (somewhat) worked, and a couple of units were installed in =
beta sites.  Sadly, Gene ran out of money (or at least didn't accept the =
terms offered) and buggered off to start yet another mainframe company =
which never shipped anything.

I was the last Engineering VP at Andor, so when it folded, I grabbed a =
few of the people and started a similar company but for the open systems =
market instead.  We named it "Ark" at my wife's suggestion as was like =
Noah's Ark - "disaster recovery" and "two of everything."  We mostly =
bootstrapped, did ship product, and were acquired by LSI Logic who were =
getting beaten around the head as EMC had a remote solution, but LSI =
didn't. I got about a dozen US Patents Issued and enough money to =
finally buy a house in Silicon Valley.

Our (SCSI-based) device had front end ports for the host(s), back-end =
ones for the devices, and side ones for the networking.  Lots of =
features, some you folks are only doing recently.  Looked like devices =
to hosts, hosts to devices.

Anyway, the point of all of this is that when we sold it to customers, =
the storage people looked at the network ports with confusion and dismay =
(some hadn't even ordered the network lines and caused months of delay), =
while the network people looked at the device ports as if they were full =
of Tasmanian devils.

Turned out, both network and storage expertise were very rare =
commodities.  This was largely why most iSCSI startups failed, they =
either did a storage product or a networking product. We pilled this off =
because I am stupid but stubborn and wrote the RTOS myself (Linux was in =
its infancy and the other RTOS's sucked).  Seemed a good idea at the =
time.  Have white papers online if anybody is interested.

So, networking people may smell funny, but to them storage people come =
from another galaxy.  Working in this industry at all could be =
considered a poor life choice but that's for another time.

Sorry. You can go back to work now.

The block layer never took references on pages.  The direct I/O helpers =
that just happened to set in block/ did hold references and abused some =
field in the bio for it (and still do for the pinning), but the =
reference was (and the pin now is) owned by the submitter.

The block layer model has always been that the submitter needs to ensure =
memory stays allocated until the I/O has completed.  Which IMHO is the =
only sane model for dealing with memory lifetimes vs I/O, and something =
networking absolutely should follow.
