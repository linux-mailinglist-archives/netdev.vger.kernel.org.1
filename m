The problem here is, you are too narrowly focused. My introduction
said:

You have not given any context. Reading the rest of your email, it
sounds like you are talking about the energy model/performance domain
for a collection of CPU cores?

Now think about Linux as a whole, not the little corner you are
interested in. Are there energy models anywhere else in Linux? What
about the GPU cores? What about Linux regulators controlling power to
peripherals? I pointed out the use case of Power over Ethernet needing
an energy model.

By system-wide, do you mean the whole of Linux? I could use it for
GPUs, regulators, PoE? Is it sufficiently generic? I somehow doubt it
is. So i think you need some sort of prefix to indicate the domain it
is applicable to. We can then add GPU energy models, PoE energy
models, etc by the side without getting into naming issues.

Naming is important, and causes a lot of pain when you get it
wrong. Linux has PHYs and generic PHYs. The PHY subsystem has been
around a long time, and generic PHY is much newer. And sometimes a PHY
has a generic PHY associated to it, so it can get really confusing
unless you are very precises with wording.

We need to be careful with any generic term, such as energy model.
