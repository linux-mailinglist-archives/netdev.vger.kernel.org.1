I think it will be extremely common to have multiple services
based on udp port 443.

People will expect to find web services, smb and maybe more
behind the same dnshost name. And multiple dnshostnames pointing
to the same ip address is also very likely.

With plain tcp/udp it's also possible to independent sockets
per port. There's no single userspace daemon that listens on
'tcp' and will dispatch into different process base on the port.

And with QUIC the port space is the ALPN and/or SNI
combination.

And I think this should be addressed before this becomes an
unchangeable kernel ABI, written is stone.

But I think its unavoidable for the ALPN and SNI fields on
the server side. As every service tries to use udp port 443
and somehow that needs to be shared if multiple services want to
use it.

I guess on the acceptor side we would need to somehow detach low level
udp struct sock from the logical listen struct sock.

And quic_do_listen_rcv() would need to find the correct logical listening
socket and call quic_request_sock_enqueue() on the logical socket
not the lowlevel udo socket. The same for all stuff happening after
quic_request_sock_enqueue() at the end of quic_do_listen_rcv.

I got it thanks!
