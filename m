Hi Guangguan and Wen,

please see my answer below.

The purpose of the restriction is to simplify the IP routing topology 
allowing IP routing to use the destination host's subnet route. Because 
each host must also have a valid IP route to the peer’s RoCE IP address 
to create RC QP. If the IP route used is the same IP Route as the 
associated TCP/IP connection, the reuse of the IP routing topology could 
be achieved. I think it is what the following sentence means in the doc 
https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/system/files/inline-files/IBM%20Shared%20Memory%20Communications%20Version%202_2.pdf

"
For HA, multiple RoCE adapters should be provisioned along with multiple 
equal cost IP routes to the peer host (i.e., reusing the TCP/IP routing 
topology).
"
And the "Figure 19. SMC-Rv2 with RoCEv2 Connectivity" in the doc also 
mentions the restriction.

The SMCRv2 on linux is indeed implemented with this purpose. Please see 
the function smc_ib_modify_qp_rtr(). During the first contact 
processing, the Mac address of the next hop IP address for the IP route 
is resolved by performing e.g. ARP and used to create the RoCEv2 RC QP. 
If the route is not usable for the RoCE IP address to reach the peer's 
RoCE IP address i.e. without this restriction, the UDP/IP packets would 
not be transported in a right way.

BTW, the fallback would still happen without the restriction. Because at 
the end of the CLC handshake(TCP/IP traffic), the first link will be 
created by sending and receiving LLC confirm message (SMCRv2 traffic). 
If one peer can just send but not receive the LLC confirm message, he 
will send CLC decline message with the reason "Time Out".

Now let's have a look at your examples above. Both of your RDMA related 
device have another IP route as the TCP/IP connection, so that the reuse 
of the IP routing topology is not possible.

Any thought still?

That is to check if the IP routing topology is the same on both sides. 
Then I'd like to ask why you use asymmetric routing for your connection? 
 From the perspective of Networking set up, does it make any sense that 
the peers communicate with each other with different IP routing topology?
