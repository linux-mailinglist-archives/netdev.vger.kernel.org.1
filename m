I've not looked at this driver in detail, nor usbnet. So i can only
make general comments. I do see there are a number of drivers which
re-invent the wheel and do their own PHY handling, when they should
allow Linux to do it via phylib/phylink.

When the MAC driver is using phylink, or phylib, it should not touch
the carrier, nor access the PHY directly. The exception can be during
probe, when it can turn the carrier off. What the MAC driver should be
doing is exposing its MDIO bus as a Linux MDIO bus. phylib will then
enumerate the bus and find the PHYs on it. The MAC driver which does
not have access to device tree then typically uses phy_find_first() to
find a PHY on the bus, and uses phy_connect() to bind the PHY to the
MAC. The MAC driver then uses phy_start() when the interface is
opened. phylib will poll the PHY for changing in link status, and call
the callback function registered via phy_connect() to let the MAC know
about what the PHY has negotiated. Other than that, the MAC driver
does nothing with the PHY.

It could well be there are historical discrepancies in usbnet, in that
having Linux drive the PHY is somewhat new for usbnet, historically
the wheel was reinvented, and maybe part of that is in the usbnet
core.
