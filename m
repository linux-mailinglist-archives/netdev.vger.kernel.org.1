None of these users are affected by the rename of the .dtsi file.

Patch 5 does have user impact, so that one would be "controversial".
From the answers I've gotten, I'm questioning which of thees files
actually has users - but that's best done in a standalone patch removing
or renaming them, with a proper commit message.

No, but the rename of the dtsi file and avoiding introducing yet another
qcs<random numbers> prefix in the soup is a huge improvement.

There was no point, all the information wasn't brought to those
discussions...

What we know now is that QCS9100 and QCS9075 (and perhaps more?) are the
Lemans IoT product line and the EVK is the main development board
there on.

It's unclear if there are any lingering users of sa8775p-ride, but
the platform we describe in sa8775p.dtsi doesn't exist anymore. To the
best of my understanding, any users of the ride hardware should be on
qcs9100-ride...

Bjorn
