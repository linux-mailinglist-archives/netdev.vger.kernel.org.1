Any issue that we witnessed in the past with low bitrates were only on
the drivers which had an hand coded TDC logic. Migrating those drivers
to the kernel TDC framework solved those issues without the need of an
additional check on the bitrate.

If you can show me a bus off condition in your device when using the
kernel TDC framework or if you can point me to publications from CAN in
Automation or similar which supports the idea of the 1 Mbit/s check,
then I can add that extra check to the framework. Otherwise, I would
like to drop this idea.

Do you see any actual incompatibilities with the kernel TDC framework on
the offset maximum value?

We can also backport the fix if using the TDC framework. The ctucanfd
driver was introduced after the TDC framework so it will apply smoothly
to stable.
