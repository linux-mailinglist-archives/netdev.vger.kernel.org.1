I think they are somewhere in Documentation/
To some extent this question in itself supports my point that written
down rules, as out of date as they may be, seem to carry more respect
than what a maintainer says :S

Not changing does not mean not depending on existing behavior.
Investigating and fixing properly even the hardest regressions in 
the stack is a bar that Meta can so easily clear. I don't understand
why you are arguing.

I think it's much easier to just run the tests than write a system
which will competently lie. But even if we completely suspend trust,
someone lying is of no cost to the community in this case.

It is not practical to ponder every change case by case. Maintainers
are overworked. How long until we send the uAPI patch for RSS on the
flow label? I'd rather not re-litigate this every time someone posts
a slightly different feature. Let's cover the obvious points from 
the beginning while everyone is paying attention. We can amend later
as need be.

The risk is we'll have a fight every time there is a disagreement about
the expectations.

That'd be great. Maybe even more than I'd expect. So why not write
it down? In case the person doing the coding is not Alex Duyck, and
just wants to get it done for their narrow use case, get a promo,
go work on something else?

Developer access would be huge.
A mirage of developer access? immaterial :)
