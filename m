+/**
+ * DOC: Bridge port enum definition
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_STATE
+ *   The operation state of the port. Here are the valid values.
+ *
+ *     * 0 - port is in STP *DISABLED* state. Make this port completely
+ *       inactive for STP. This is also called BPDU filter and could be used
+ *       to disable STP on an untrusted port, like a leaf virtual device.
+ *       The traffic forwarding is also stopped on this port.
+ *     * 1 - port is in STP *LISTENING* state. Only valid if STP is enabled
+ *       on the bridge. In this state the port listens for STP BPDUs and
+ *       drops all other traffic frames.
+ *     * 2 - port is in STP *LEARNING* state. Only valid if STP is enabled on
+ *       the bridge. In this state the port will accept traffic only for the
+ *       purpose of updating MAC address tables.
+ *     * 3 - port is in STP *FORWARDING* state. Port is fully active.
+ *     * 4 - port is in STP *BLOCKING* state. Only valid if STP is enabled on
+ *       the bridge. This state is used during the STP election process.
+ *       In this state, port will only process STP BPDUs.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_PRIORITY
+ *   The STP port priority. The valid values are between 0 and 255.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_COST
+ *   The STP path cost of the port. The valid values are between 1 and 65535.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_MODE
+ *   Set the bridge port mode. See *BRIDGE_MODE_HAIRPIN* for more details.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_GUARD
+ *   Controls whether STP BPDUs will be processed by the bridge port. By
+ *   default, the flag is turned off to allow BPDU processing. Turning this
+ *   flag on will disable the bridge port if a STP BPDU packet is received.
+ *
+ *   If the bridge has Spanning Tree enabled, hostile devices on the network
+ *   may send BPDU on a port and cause network failure. Setting *guard on*
+ *   will detect and stop this by disabling the port. The port will be
+ *   restarted if the link is brought down, or removed and reattached.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_PROTECT
+ *   Controls whether a given port is allowed to become a root port or not.
+ *   Only used when STP is enabled on the bridge. By default the flag is off.
+ *
+ *   This feature is also called root port guard. If BPDU is received from a
+ *   leaf (edge) port, it should not be elected as root port. This could
+ *   be used if using STP on a bridge and the downstream bridges are not fully
+ *   trusted; this prevents a hostile guest from rerouting traffic.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_FAST_LEAVE
+ *   This flag allows the bridge to immediately stop multicast traffic
+ *   forwarding on a port that receives an IGMP Leave message. It is only used
+ *   when IGMP snooping is enabled on the bridge. By default the flag is off.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_LEARNING
+ *   Controls whether a given port will learn *source* MAC addresses from
+ *   received traffic or not. Also controls whether dynamic FDB entries
+ *   (which can also be added by software) will be refreshed by incoming
+ *   traffic. By default this flag is on.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_UNICAST_FLOOD
+ *   Controls whether unicast traffic for which there is no FDB entry will
+ *   be flooded towards this port. By default this flag is on.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_PROXYARP
+ *   Enable proxy ARP on this port.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_LEARNING_SYNC
+ *   Controls whether a given port will sync MAC addresses learned on device
+ *   port to bridge FDB.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_PROXYARP_WIFI
+ *   Enable proxy ARP on this port which meets extended requirements by
+ *   IEEE 802.11 and Hotspot 2.0 specifications.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_ROOT_ID
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_BRIDGE_ID
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_DESIGNATED_PORT
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_DESIGNATED_COST
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_ID
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_NO
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_TOPOLOGY_CHANGE_ACK
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_CONFIG_PENDING
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_MESSAGE_AGE_TIMER
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_FORWARD_DELAY_TIMER
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_HOLD_TIMER
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_FLUSH
+ *   Flush bridge ports' fdb dynamic entries.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_MULTICAST_ROUTER
+ *   Configure the port's multicast router presence. A port with
+ *   a multicast router will receive all multicast traffic.
+ *   The valid values are:
+ *
+ *     * 0 disable multicast routers on this port
+ *     * 1 let the system detect the presence of routers (default)
+ *     * 2 permanently enable multicast traffic forwarding on this port
+ *     * 3 enable multicast routers temporarily on this port, not depending
+ *         on incoming queries.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_PAD
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_MCAST_FLOOD
+ *   Controls whether a given port will flood multicast traffic for which
+ *   there is no MDB entry. By default this flag is on.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_MCAST_TO_UCAST
+ *   Controls whether a given port will replicate packets using unicast
+ *   instead of multicast. By default this flag is off.
+ *
+ *   This is done by copying the packet per host and changing the multicast
+ *   destination MAC to a unicast one accordingly.
+ *
+ *   *mcast_to_unicast* works on top of the multicast snooping feature of the
+ *   bridge. Which means unicast copies are only delivered to hosts which
+ *   are interested in unicast and signaled this via IGMP/MLD reports previously.
+ *
+ *   This feature is intended for interface types which have a more reliable
+ *   and/or efficient way to deliver unicast packets than broadcast ones
+ *   (e.g. WiFi).
+ *
+ *   However, it should only be enabled on interfaces where no IGMPv2/MLDv1
+ *   report suppression takes place. IGMP/MLD report suppression issue is
+ *   usually overcome by the network daemon (supplicant) enabling AP isolation
+ *   and by that separating all STAs.
+ *
+ *   Delivery of STA-to-STA IP multicast is made possible again by enabling
+ *   and utilizing the bridge hairpin mode, which considers the incoming port
+ *   as a potential outgoing port, too (see *BRIDGE_MODE_HAIRPIN* option).
+ *   Hairpin mode is performed after multicast snooping, therefore leading
+ *   to only deliver reports to STAs running a multicast router.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_VLAN_TUNNEL
+ *   Controls whether vlan to tunnel mapping is enabled on the port.
+ *   By default this flag is off.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_BCAST_FLOOD
+ *   Controls flooding of broadcast traffic on the given port. By default
+ *   this flag is on.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_GROUP_FWD_MASK
+ *   Set the group forward mask. This is a bitmask that is applied to
+ *   decide whether to forward incoming frames destined to link-local
+ *   addresses. The addresses of the form are 01:80:C2:00:00:0X (defaults
+ *   to 0, which means the bridge does not forward any link-local frames
+ *   coming on this port).
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_NEIGH_SUPPRESS
+ *   Controls whether neighbor discovery (arp and nd) proxy and suppression
+ *   is enabled on the port. By default this flag is off.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_ISOLATED
+ *   Controls whether a given port will be isolated, which means it will be
+ *   able to communicate with non-isolated ports only. By default this
+ *   flag is off.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_BACKUP_PORT
+ *   Set a backup port. If the port loses carrier all traffic will be
+ *   redirected to the configured backup port. Set the value to 0 to disable
+ *   it.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_MRP_RING_OPEN
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_MRP_IN_OPEN
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_MCAST_EHT_HOSTS_LIMIT
+ *   The number of per-port EHT hosts limit. The default value is 512.
+ *   Setting to 0 is not allowed.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_MCAST_EHT_HOSTS_CNT
+ *   The current number of tracked hosts, read only.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_LOCKED
+ *   Controls whether a port will be locked, meaning that hosts behind the
+ *   port will not be able to communicate through the port unless an FDB
+ *   entry with the unit's MAC address is in the FDB. The common use case is
+ *   that hosts are allowed access through authentication with the IEEE 802.1X
+ *   protocol or based on whitelists. By default this flag is off.
+ *
+ *   Please note that secure 802.1X deployments should always use the
+ *   *BR_BOOLOPT_NO_LL_LEARN* flag, to not permit the bridge to populate its
+ *   FDB based on link-local (EAPOL) traffic received on the port.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_MAB
+ *   Controls whether a port will use MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB), a
+ *   technique through which select MAC addresses may be allowed on a locked
+ *   port, without using 802.1X authentication. Packets with an unknown source
+ *   MAC address generates a "locked" FDB entry on the incoming bridge port.
+ *   The common use case is for user space to react to these bridge FDB
+ *   notifications and optionally replace the locked FDB entry with a normal
+ *   one, allowing traffic to pass for whitelisted MAC addresses.
+ *
+ *   Setting this flag also requires *IFLA_BRPORT_LOCKED* and
+ *   *IFLA_BRPORT_LEARNING*. *IFLA_BRPORT_LOCKED* ensures that unauthorized
+ *   data packets are dropped, and *IFLA_BRPORT_LEARNING* allows the dynamic
+ *   FDB entries installed by user space (as replacements for the locked FDB
+ *   entries) to be refreshed and/or aged out.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_MCAST_N_GROUPS
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_MCAST_MAX_GROUPS
+ *   Sets the maximum number of MDB entries that can be registered for a
+ *   given port. Attempts to register more MDB entries at the port than this
+ *   limit allows will be rejected, whether they are done through netlink
+ *   (e.g. the bridge tool), or IGMP or MLD membership reports. Setting a
+ *   limit of 0 disables the limit. The default value is 0.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_NEIGH_VLAN_SUPPRESS
+ *   Controls whether neighbor discovery (arp and nd) proxy and suppression is
+ *   enabled for a given port. By default this flag is off.
+ *
+ *   Note that this option only takes effect when *IFLA_BRPORT_NEIGH_SUPPRESS*
+ *   is enabled for a given port.
+ *
+ * @IFLA_BRPORT_BACKUP_NHID
+ *   The FDB nexthop object ID to attach to packets being redirected to a
+ *   backup port that has VLAN tunnel mapping enabled (via the
+ *   *IFLA_BRPORT_VLAN_TUNNEL* option). Setting a value of 0 (default) has
+ *   the effect of not attaching any ID.
