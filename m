It is not the concern about the kfuncs may leak object.

I think my question was, who can use the act_bpf_kern object when all tc bpf 
prog is unloaded? If no one can use it, it should as well be cleaned up when the 
bpf prog is unloaded.

or the kernel p4 pipeline can use the act_bpf_kern object even when there is no 
bpf prog loaded?

bpf is also used by many subsystems (e.g. tracing/cgroup/...). The bpf users 
have a common expectation on how bpf resources will be cleaned up when writing 
bpf for different subsystems, i.e. map/link/pinned-file. Thus, p4 pipeline is 
not the same as a pinned bpf map here. The p4-tc bpf user cannot depend on the 
common bpf ecosystem to cleanup all resources.

It is going back to how link/fd and the map ops discussion by others in the 
earlier revisions which we probably don't want to redo here. I think I have been 
making enough noise such that we don't have to discuss potential future changes 
about how to release this resources when the bpf prog is unloaded.
