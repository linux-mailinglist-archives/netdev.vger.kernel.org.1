I am not sure if I understand what you meant here, do you meant something
like dmapool_test_alloc() does as something like below?

static int page_frag_test_alloc(void **p, int blocks)
{
	int i;

	for (i = 0; i < blocks; i++) {
		p[i] = page_frag_alloc(&test_frag, test_alloc_len, GFP_KERNEL);

		if (!p[i])
			goto pool_fail;
	}

	for (i = 0; i < blocks; i++)
		page_frag_free(p[i]);

	....
}

The above was my initial thinking too, I went to the ptrpool thing using
at least two CPUs as the below reason:
1. Test the concurrent calling between allocing and freeing more throughly,
   for example, page->_refcount concurrent handling, cache draining and
   cache reusing code path will be tested more throughly.
2. Test the performance impact of cache bouncing between different CPUs.

I am not sure if there is a more lightweight implementation than ptrpool
to do the above testing more throughly.

I had the same feeling as you, but when doing testing, it seems
convenient enough to do a 'insmod xxx.ko' for testing without a
'rmmod xxx.ko'

I failed to find one example of test kernel module that is in the
selftests tree yet. If it does make sense, please provide an example
here, and I am willing to follow the pattern if there is one.

I suppose you meant dmapool is built-in to the kernel and run at early
boot? I am not sure what is the point of built-in for dmapool, as it
only do one-time testing, and built-in for dmapool only waste some
memory when testing is done.

As above, it seems convenient enough to do a 'insmod xxx.ko' for testing
without a 'rmmod xxx.ko'.
