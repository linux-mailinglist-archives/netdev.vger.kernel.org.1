Apologies for the delay in response. I understand that the PCS<->PHY
clocks may be out of the scope of PCS DT due to the reasons you mention.
However would like to clarify that the MII clocks referred to here, are
part of the connection between the MAC and PCS and not between PCS and PHY.

Below is a diagram that shows the sub-blocks inside the 'UNIPHY' block
of IPQ9574 which houses the PCS and the serdes, along with the clock
connectivity. The MII Rx/Tx clocks are supplied from the NSS CC, to the
GMII channels between PCS and MAC. So, it seemed appropriate to have
these clocks described as part of the PCS DT node.

We had one other question on the approach used in the driver for PCS
clocks, could you please provide your comments.

As we can see from the above diagram, each serdes in the UNIPHY block
provides the clocks to the NSSCC, and the PCS block consumes the MII
Rx/Tx clocks. In our current design, the PCS/UNIPHY driver registers a
provider driver for the clocks that the serdes supplies to the NSS CC.
It also enables the MII Rx/Tx clocks which are supplied to the PCS from
the NSS CC. Would this be an acceptable design to have the PCS driver
register the clock provider driver and also consume the MII Rx/Tx
clocks? It may be worth noting that the serdes and PCS are part of the
same UNIPHY block and also share same register region.

Thank you.
