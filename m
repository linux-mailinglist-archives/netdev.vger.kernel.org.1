Just note that, with a bit change in the current libquic, it still
allows users to use ALPN to find the correct function or thread in
the *same* process, usage be like:

listenfd =3D socket(IPPROTO_QUIC);
/* match all during handshake with wildcard ALPN */
setsockopt(listenfd, QUIC_SOCKOPT_ALPN, "*");
bind(listenfd)
listen(listenfd)

while (1) {
  sockfd =3D accept(listenfd);
  /* the alpn from client will be set to sockfd during handshake */
  quic_server_handshake(sockfd, cert);

  getsockopt(sockfd, QUIC_SOCKOPT_ALPN, alpn);

  switch (alpn) {
    case "smbd": smbd_thread(sockfd);
    case "h3": h3_thread(sockfd);
    case "ksmbd": ksmbd_thread(sockfd);
  }
}

Got you. This can be done by also moving TLS 1.3 message exchange to
kernel where we can get the ALPN before looking up the listening socket.
However, In-kernel TLS 1.3 Handshake had been NACKed by both kernel
netdev maintainers and userland ssl lib developers with good reasons.

Honestly, I don't think any userland QUIC can use ALPN to lookup for
different sockets used by different servers/processes. As such thing
can be only done in Kernel Space.

Good question!

The first "new" QUIC pdu will cause to create a 'request sock' (contains
4-tuple and connection IDs only) and queue up to reqsk list of the listen
sock (if validate_peer_address param is not set), and this pdu is enqueued
in the inq->backlog_list of the listen sock.

When accept() is called, in Kernel, it dequeues the "request sock" from the
reqsk list of the listen sock, and creates the accept socket based on this
reqsk. Then it processes the pdu for this new accept socket from the
inq->backlog_list of the listen sock, including *decrypting* QUIC packet
and decoding CRYPTO frame, then deliver the raw/cleartext TLS message to
the Userspace libquic.

Then in Userspace libquic, it handles the received TLS message and creates
a new raw/cleartext TLS message for response via libgnutls, and delivers to
kernel. In kernel, it will encode this message to a CRYPTO frame in a QUIC
packet and then *encrypt* this QUIC packet and send it out.

So as you can see, there's no en/decryption happening in Userspace. In
Userspace libquic, it only does raw/cleartext TLS message exchange. ALL
en/decryption happens in Kernel Space, as these en/decryption are done
against QUIC packets, not directly against the TLS messages.

so that userspace consumers don't need quic_client/server_handshake(), and
accept() returns a socket that already has the handshake done, right?

We didn't do that, as:

1. It's not a good idea for Userspace consumers' applications to reply on
   a daemon like tlshd, not convenient for users, also a bit weird for
   userspace app to ask another userspace app to help do the handshake.
2. It's too complex to implement, especially if we also want to call
   tls_client_hello_x509() before connect() returns on client side.
3. For Kernel usage, I prefer leaving this to the kernel consumers for
   more flexibility for handshake requests.

As for the ALPNs with certificates, not sure if I understand correctly.
But if you want the server to select certificates according to the ALPN
received from the client during handshake. I think it could be done in
userspace libquic. But yes, tlshd service may also need to extend.
