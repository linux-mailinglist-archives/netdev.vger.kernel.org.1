I was talking together with Emanuele on this topic and we are confused
on how to proceed.

From the various comments and tests in this thread, to me the actual
code change is correct, the dp83867 does not support EEE and we have to
explicitly disable it in the dp83867 driver.

As of now we do not have a clear shared understanding on what is going
on in the stmmac driver. And the commit message is not correct on this
regard.

This patch is already merged [1] in netdev tree, should we send a series
reverting this commit and another commit with just the same change and a
different commit message? 

In parallel, unrelated to the dp83867 topic, Emanuele is trying to help
figuring out why the actual behavior of the stmmac changed after Russell
refactoring. And it's clear that this change in behavior is not expected.

[1] commit 84a905290cb4 ("net: phy: dp83867: Disable EEE support as not implemented")
