You should always follow standard properties unless they don't
work. And if they don't work, your commit message needs to explain why
they don't work forcing your to do something special.

Maybe you should go read the RGMII standard, and then think about how
your hardware actually works.

RGMII always has a variable clock, with different clock speeds for
10/100/1G. So your board design is just plain normal, not
special. Does the standard talk about different delays for different
speeds? As you say, other drivers apply the same delay for all
speeds. Why should your hardware be special?

RGMII has been around for 25 years. Do you really think your RGMII
implementation needs something special which no other implementation
has needed in the last 25 years?

You can do it in the MAC. But you probably want to clearly document
this, that your design is different to > 95% of systems in Linux which
have the PHY do the delays.
