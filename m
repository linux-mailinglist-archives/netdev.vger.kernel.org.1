Qualcomm ethernet HW supports 2.5G speed in overclocked SGMII mode.
we internally term it as OCSGMII.

End goal of these patches is to enable SGMII with 2.5G speed support.
The patch in these series enabled up SGMII with 2.5 for cases where we
don't have external phy. ( mac-to-mac connectivity)
The new patch posted extends this for the case when the MAC has an
external phy connected. ( hence we are advertising fr 2.5G speed by adding
2500BASEX as supported interface in phylink)

In this version of qualcomm ethernet, PCS is not an independent HW
block. It is integrated to MAC block itself. It has very limited
configuration.Here PCS doesn't have it's own link speed/duplex
capabities. Hence we are bypassing all this PCS related functionalities.


I will update with more details on the integrated PCS block autoneg
standard.
