Just a quick correction - this is not entirely correct. It's speed,
duplex and "lanes" is defined by interface mode.

For example, 10GBASER is a single lane, as is SGMII, 1000BASE-X,
2500BASE-X. XLGMII and CGMII are defined by 802.3 as 8 lanes (clause
81.)

speed and duplex just define the speed operated over the link defined
by the PHY interface mode.

(I've previously described why we don't go to that depth with fixed
links, but to briefly state it, it's what we've done in the past and
it's visible to the user, and we try to avoid breaking userspace.)

Don't vendors already implement downshift for cases where there are
problems with lanes/cabling?

If you aren't actually 40G, then you aren't actually XLGMII as
defined by 802.3... so that begs the question - what are you!

That is most certainly *not* what the SFP code is doing. As things stand
today, everything respects the PHY interface mode, if it says SGMII then
we get SGMII. If it says 1000BASE-X, we get 1000BASE-X. If it says
2500BASE-X, then that's what we get... and so on.

The SFP code has added support to switch between 2500BASE-X and
1000BASE-X because this is a use case with optical SFPs that can operate
at either speed. That's why this happens for the SFP case.

For PHYs, modern PHYs switch their host facing interface, so we support
the interface mode changing there - under the control of the PHY and
most certainly not under user control (the user doesn't know how the
PHY has been configured and whether the PHY does switch or rate
adapt.)

For everything else, we're in fixed host interface mode, because that
is how we've been - and to do anything else is new development.
