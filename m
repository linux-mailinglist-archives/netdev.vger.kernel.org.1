This is fine in this issue, but for rigor, I'll add locks to all related
ioctl and route frame operations to maintain synchronization.
I will send V3 patch to improve it.

I don't think this is correct.

No, setting locked = 1 is only done in nr_add_neigh(), and nr_neigh_hold()
is not executed, and the refcount value is 1.

No, No, I know where your analysis went wrong, it is here.

The problem is not when allocating neigh and adding it to routes[2],
but when nr_add_node is executed twice later, one is Task0 as I mentioned
above, and the other is Task1.
After Task1 moves the neighbor out of routes, Task0 uses nr_neigh_get_dev()
to get the neighbor that Task1 moved out, and then adds it to its routes.
This is wrong. Task0 should not use nr_neigh_get_dev() to obtain the neighbor
before other tasks move it out. This will interfere with the reference count
of the neighbor, which is the root cause of the problem.
