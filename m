How much is specific to your device? How much is just following 802.3
and the CMIS standards? I assume anything which is just following
802.3 and CMIS could actually be re-used? And you have some glue to
combine them in a way that is specific to your device?

Maybe not, but you might of gained from the community here, if others
could of adopted this code for their devices. You might not need
clause 73, but phylink provides helpers to implement it, so it is
pretty easy to add. Maybe your initial PCS driver does not support it,
but later adopters who also licence this PCS might add it, and you get
the feature for free. The corrected/uncorrected counters i asked
about, are something you might not export in your current code via
ethtool. But again, this is something which somebody else could add a
helper for, and you would get it nearly for free.

Another place you might of got features for free. The Linux SFP driver
exports HWMON values for temperature, power, received power, etc, but
for 1G. The QSFP+ standard Versatile Diagnostics Monitoring is
different, but i could see somebody adding a generic implementation in
the Linux SFP driver, so that the HWMON support is just free. Same
goes for the error performance statics. Parts of power management
could easily be generic. It might be possible to use Linux regulators
to describe what your board is capable if, and the SFP core could then
implement the ethtool ops, checking with the regulator to see if the
power is actually available, and then talking to the SFP to tell it to
change its power class?

Florian posted some interesting statistics, that vendors tend to
maintain their own drivers, and don't get much support from the
community. However i suspect it is a different story for shared
infrastructure like PCS drivers, PHY drivers, SFP drivers. That is
where you get the most community support and the most stuff for free.
But you actually have to use it to benefit from it.
