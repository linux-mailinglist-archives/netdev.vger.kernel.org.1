The advantage of Meta not selling it publicly at this time is that
Meta is both the consumer and the maintainer so if a kernel API change
broke something Meta would be responsible for fixing it. It would be
Meta's own interest to maintain the part, and if it breaks Meta would
be the only one impacted assuming the breaking change at least builds.
So rather than "good faith", maybe I should have said "motivated self
interest".

It seems like the worst case scenario would actually be some
commercial product being sold. Worse yet, one with proprietary bits
such as firmware on the device. Should commercial vendors be required
to provide some sort of documentation proving they are dedicated to
their product and financially stable enough to maintain it for the
entire product life cycle? What if the vendor sells some significant
number of units to Linux users out there, and then either goes under,
gets acquired, and/or just decides to go in a new direction. In that
scenario we have the driver unmaintained and consumers impacted, but
the company responsible for it has no motivation to address it other
than maybe negative PR.

This is what I was referring to as being "arbitrary and capricious".
The issue is what would we define as a NIC being for sale
commercially. Do we have to support a certain form factor, sell it for
a certain price, or sell a certain quantity?

If anything maybe we should look more at something like a blast radius
in terms of inclusion. If this were to go wrong, how could it go wrong
and who would be impacted.

Thanks for your reply. I had started a reply, but you probably worded
this better than I could have.

Thanks
