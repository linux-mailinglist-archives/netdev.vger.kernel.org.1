Should I ignore this if I choose to use the following standard properties?

This board was designed to operate at different speed rates, not a fixed 
speed, and the clock rate varies for each speed. Thus, the delay 
introduced by inverting the clock is not fixed. Additionally, I noticed 
that some vendors apply the same routine for this property across all 
speeds in their driver code. Can this property be used just as a flag, 
regardless of its actual value?

The delay for both TX and RX sides is added by the MAC in the Qualcomm 
driver, which was introduced by the initial patch. I believe there may 
be a refactor in the future to ensure it follows the requirements.

Yes, I will make a note of it.
