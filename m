Don't want to start a discussion and thanks a lot for pointing this
out. This is really to talk about this and not contradict you.

Yes it's not true, and I was wrong but still I watch other driver
outside PHY and normally probe should not do that kind of stuff.
(even the comments describing the use in phy.h doesn't say that it
should be used for configuring the PHY only once on discovery)

Watching some of the thing, I feel all of this is done in probe as it's
not called again on software reset (as it will call config_init again).

This looks like there is a missing feature here and maybe a chance to
improve this?

Wonder if adding an additional OP would be beneficial to this?
Was thinking to something like

.config_once ?

And add some comments that it's called only on PHY discovery?
It would be put right after the probe call in phy_core.

I just checked Datasheet, on HW reset it's enabled again and on SW reset
value is retained. So yes it must stay in probe as it will cause side
effect if WoL get enabled after... Really hope the config_once thing is
OK since it will make things much cleaner.
