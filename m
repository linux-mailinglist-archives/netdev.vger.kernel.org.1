Hi,

This is follow-up to the ongoing discussion started by Intel to extend the
support for TX shaping H/W offload [1].

The goal is allowing the user-space to configure TX shaping offload on a
per-queue basis with min guaranteed B/W, max B/W limit and burst size on a
VF device.


In the past few months several different solutions were attempted and
discussed, without finding a perfect fit:

- devlink_rate APIs are not appropriate for to control TX shaping on netdevs
- No existing TC qdisc offload covers the required feature set
- HTB does not allow direct queue configuration
- MQPRIO imposes constraint on the maximum number of TX queues
- TBF does not support max B/W limit
- ndo_set_tx_maxrate() only controls the max B/W limit

A new H/W offload API is needed, but offload API proliferation should be
avoided.

The following proposal intends to cover the above specified requirement and
provide a possible base to unify all the shaping offload APIs mentioned above.

The following only defines the in-kernel interface between the core and
drivers. The intention is to expose the feature to user-space via Netlink.
Hopefully the latter part should be straight-forward after agreement
on the in-kernel interface.

All feedback and comment is more then welcome!
