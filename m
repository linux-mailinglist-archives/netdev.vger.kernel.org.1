I took these addresses from your previous reply. You can customize as
needed, to find out the bridge behavior for any group, of course.

If you see the "can't test with group_fwd_mask" error, it means that the
bridge is outright refusing to forward this particular group. See
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.12.6/A/ident/BR_GROUPFWD_RESTRICTED
for more details.

For example, the bridge refuses to forward 01-80-c2-00-00-00 and the
question is why you would want to do that. "Previous behavior" doesn't
always mean "correct behavior".

Whereas group 01-80-c2-00-00-0e, as far as I can see, can be forwarded
fine by the software bridge when BIT(14) is set in the bridge group_fwd_mask.
For such groups, an accelerator has nothing more to do than ensure
skb->offload_fwd_mark = 0 on RX, and trap them exclusively to the CPU.
