The implementation allows one low level UDP sock to serve for multiple
QUIC socks.

Currently, if your 3 quic applications listen to the same address:port
with SO_REUSEPORT socket option set, the incoming connection will choose
one of your applications randomly with hash(client_addr+port) via
reuseport_select_sock() in quic_sock_lookup().

It should be easy to do a further match with ALPN between these 3 quic
socks that listens to the same address:port to get the right quic sock,
instead of that randomly choosing.

The problem is to parse the TLS Client_Hello message to get the ALPN in
quic_sock_lookup(), which is not a proper thing to do in kernel, and
might be rejected by networking maintainers, I need to check with them.

Will you be able to work around this by using Unix Domain Sockets pass
the sockfd to another process?

(Note that we're assuming all your 3 applications are using in-kernel QUIC)
