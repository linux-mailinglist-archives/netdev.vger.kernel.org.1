Hi Guangguan,

Thank you for the questions. We also asked ourselves the same questions 
a while ago, and also did some research on it. Unfortunately, it was not 
yet done and I had to delay it because of my vacation last month. Now 
it's time to pick it up again ;) I'll come back to you as soon as I can 
give a very certain answer.

Thanks,
Wenjia
