In January, send a new set (RFC if it is still the merge window) with
the following:

1. audit all of the uses of RTF_EXPIRES. Some of the places need to be
cleaned up first. For example, rt6_add_dflt_router sets RTF_EXPIRES flag
but does not set fc_expires. I believe that function can be updated to
take the expires value and removes the need to set it later in
ndisc_router_discovery. See if the management of expires value can be
consolidated under the table lock.

2. Use gc_list instead of gc_link to be consistent with other gc lists
(and the fact that it is a list)

3. Add selftests using veth and namespaces to test RAs. It can depend on
and check for the existence of the ra or radvd command; the key is to
attempt a stress test on the router discovery path. Similarly for addrconf.

That is in addition to your new selftests in the last set you sent.
