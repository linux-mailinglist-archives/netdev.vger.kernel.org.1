+Diagnostic Concept for Investigating Twisted Pair Ethernet Variants at OSI Layer 1
+==================================================================================
+
+Introduction
+------------
+
+This documentation is designed for two primary audiences:
+
+1. **Users and System Administrators**: For those dealing with real-world
+   Ethernet issues, this guide provides a practical, step-by-step
+   troubleshooting flow to help identify and resolve common problems in Twisted
+   Pair Ethernet at OSI Layer 1. If you're facing unstable links, speed drops,
+   or mysterious network issues, jump right into the step-by-step guide and
+   follow it through to find your solution.
+
+2. **Kernel Developers**: For developers working with network drivers and PHY
+   support, this documentation outlines the diagnostic process and highlights
+   areas where the Linux kernel’s diagnostic interfaces could be extended or
+   improved. By understanding the diagnostic flow, developers can better
+   prioritize future enhancements.
+
+Structure
+------------
+
+The document is divided into two parts:
+
+- **Part 1: Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide**: This is for those who need
+  immediate help with their networking issues. We get it - no one wants to sift
+  through endless technical descriptions when the link is down. This section
+  provides concise, actionable steps to get your network up and running as
+  quickly as possible.
+
+- **Part 2: In-Depth Descriptions and Technical Insights**: For those who want
+  to dig deeper, this section offers detailed descriptions of hardware
+  specifications, typical problems, and diagnostic techniques. It provides
+  context for the issues addressed in the troubleshooting guide and serves as a
+  reference for developers and network engineers who need to understand the
+  reasoning behind each step.
+
+By the end of this documentation, whether you’re a frustrated admin or a
+curious developer, we hope you’ll have the tools and understanding necessary to
+diagnose and resolve twisted pair Ethernet issues at the physical layer. And if
+you discover new or unresolved problems, feel free to extend this documentation
+with your findings!
+
+Step-by-Step Diagnostic Guide from Linux (General Ethernet)
+-----------------------------------------------------------
+
+This diagnostic guide covers common Ethernet troubleshooting scenarios,
+focusing on **link stability and detection** across different Ethernet
+environments, including **Single-Pair Ethernet (SPE)** and **Multi-Pair
+Ethernet (MPE)**, as well as power delivery technologies like **PoDL** (Power
+over Data Line) and **PoE** (Clause 33 PSE).
+
+Diagnostic Scenarios
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+- **Link is up and stable, but no data transfer**: If the link is stable but
+  there are issues with data transmission, refer to the **OSI Layer 2
+  Troubleshooting Guide**.
+
+- **Link is unstable**: Link resets, speed drops, or other fluctuations
+  indicate potential issues at the hardware or physical layer.
+
+- **No link detected**: The interface is up, but no link is established.
+
+Verify Interface Status
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Start by checking the status of the Ethernet interface to see if it is
+administratively up.
+
+- **Command:** `ip link show dev <interface>`
+- **Expected Output:**
+
+  .. code-block:: bash
+
+    4: eth0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 ...
+       link/ether 88:14:2b:00:96:f2 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
+
+- **If Output:**
+
+  - Interface is down: Bring the interface up using `ip link set dev eth0 up`.
+  - Interface is up but shows `NO-CARRIER` Proceed to the **Inspect Link Status
+    and PHY Configuration** step.
+
+Inspect Link Status and PHY Configuration
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Use `ethtool` to check the link status, PHY configuration, and supported link
+modes.
+
+- **Command:** `ethtool <interface>`
+- **Expected Output:**
+
+  .. code-block:: bash
+
+    Settings for eth0:
+       Supported link modes:  1000baseT/Full, 100baseT/Full
+       Advertised link modes: 1000baseT/Full
+       Speed: Unknown!
+       Duplex: Unknown! (255)
+       Auto-negotiation: on
+       Link detected: no
+
+- Information to Gather:
+
+  - Supported link modes. This gives insights into the type of technology used.
+    If you see modes like **1000baseT1**, **100baseT1**, or **10baseT1S**, it
+    likely indicates that this is a **Single-Pair Ethernet (SPE)** link,
+    which typically does not support autonegotiation.
+    **Note:** In such cases, you can **skip the comparison of advertised
+    link modes**, as neither link partner will advertise any mode.
+
+- **Scenarios:**
+
+  - **Link is up and stable, but transfer issues exist**: This may indicate a
+    duplex mismatch. Proceed to the **Verify Link Partner PHY Configuration**
+    step.
+  - **Unstable Link**: If the link is fluctuating, showing intermittent resets
+    or speed drops, proceed to the **Cable and Power Diagnostics** step.
+  - **No Link**: If `Link detected: no`, continue with further diagnostics.
+
+Check Power Delivery (PoDL or PoE)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+If it is known that **PoDL** or **PoE** is **not implemented** on the system,
+or the **PSE** (Power Sourcing Equipment) is managed by proprietary user-space
+software or external tools, you can skip this step. In such cases, verify power
+delivery through alternative methods, such as checking hardware indicators
+(LEDs), using multimeters, or consulting vendor-specific software for
+monitoring power status.
+
+If **PoDL** or **PoE** is implemented and managed directly by Linux, follow
+these steps to ensure power is being delivered correctly:
+
+- **For PoDL (Single-Pair Ethernet)**:
+
+  - **Command:** `ethtool --show-pse <interface>`
+  - **Expected Output (PoDL)**:
+
+    .. code-block:: bash
+
+      PSE attributes for eth1:
+      PoDL PSE Admin State: enabled
+      PoDL PSE Power Detection Status: delivering power
+
+- **For PoE (Clause 33 PSE)**:
+
+  - **Command:** `ethtool --show-pse <interface>`
+  - **Expected Output (PoE)**:
+
+    .. code-block:: bash
+
+      PSE attributes for eth1:
+      Clause 33 PSE Admin State: enabled
+      Clause 33 PSE Power Detection Status: delivering power
+      Clause 33 PSE Available Power Limit: 18000
+
+- **Adjust Power Limit (if needed)**:
+
+  - Sometimes, the available power limit may not be sufficient for the link
+    partner. You can increase the power limit as needed.
+
+  - **Command:** `ethtool --set-pse <interface> c33-pse-avail-pw-limit <limit>`
+
+    Example:
+
+    .. code-block:: bash
+
+      ethtool --set-pse eth1 c33-pse-avail-pw-limit 18000
+      ethtool --show-pse eth1
+
+    **Expected Output** after adjusting the power limit:
+
+    .. code-block:: bash
+
+      Clause 33 PSE Available Power Limit: 18000
+
+- **Scenarios**:
+
+  - **Power Not Delivered**: If the `Power Detection Status` shows something
+    other than "delivering power" (e.g., `over current` or `disabled`),
+    troubleshoot the PSE or check for a short circuit in the cable.
+  - **Power Delivered but No Link**: If power is being delivered but no link is
+    established, proceed to **Cable Diagnostics** or **Inspect Link Status and
+    PHY Configuration** for further troubleshooting.
+
+Perform Cable Diagnostics
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Use `ethtool` to test for physical layer issues such as cable faults. The test
+results can vary depending on the cable's condition, the technology in use, and
+the state of the link partner. The results from the cable test will help in
+diagnosing issues like open circuits, shorts, impedance mismatches, and
+noise-related problems.
+
+- **Command:** `ethtool --cable-test <interface>`
+
+The following are the typical outputs for **Single-Pair Ethernet (SPE)** and
+**Multi-Pair Ethernet (MPE)**:
+
+- **For Single-Pair Ethernet (SPE)**:
+  - **Expected Output (SPE)**:
+
+  .. code-block:: bash
+
+    Cable test completed for device eth1.
+    Pair A, fault length: 25.00m
+    Pair A code Open Circuit
+
+  This indicates an open circuit or cable fault at the reported distance, but
+  results can be influenced by the link partner's state. Refer to the
+  **"Troubleshooting Based on Cable Test Results"** section for further
+  interpretation of these results.
+
+- **For Multi-Pair Ethernet (MPE)**:
+  - **Expected Output (MPE)**:
+
+  .. code-block:: bash
+
+    Cable test completed for device eth0.
+    Pair A code OK
+    Pair B code OK
+    Pair C code Open Circuit
+
+  Here, Pair C is reported as having an open circuit, while Pairs A and B are
+  functioning correctly. However, if autonegotiation is in use on Pairs A and
+  B, the cable test may be disrupted. Refer to the **"Troubleshooting Based on
+  Cable Test Results"** section for a detailed explanation of these issues and
+  how to resolve them.
+
+For detailed descriptions of the different possible cable test results, please
+refer to the **"Troubleshooting Based on Cable Test Results"** section.
+
+Troubleshooting Based on Cable Test Results
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+After running the cable test, the results can help identify specific issues in
+the physical connection. The results can be one of the following:
+
+- **OK**:
+
+  - The cable is functioning correctly, and no issues were detected.
+
+  - **Action**: If you are still experiencing issues, it might be related to
+    higher-layer problems, such as duplex mismatches or speed negotiation,
+    which are not physical-layer issues.
+
+  - **Special Case for `BaseT1` (1000/100/10BaseT1)**: In `BaseT1` systems, an
+    "OK" result typically also means that the link is up and likely in **slave
+    mode**, since cable tests usually only pass in this mode. For some
+    **10BaseT1L** PHYs, an "OK" result may occur even if the cable is too long
+    for the PHY's configured range (for example, when the range is configured
+    for short-distance mode).
+
+- **Open Circuit**:
+
+  - An **Open Circuit** result typically indicates that the cable is damaged or
+    disconnected at the reported fault length. Consider these possibilities:
+
+    - If the link partner is in **admin down** state or powered off, you might
+      still get an "Open Circuit" result even if the cable is functional.
+
+    - **Action**: Inspect the cable at the fault length for visible damage or
+      loose connections. Verify the link partner is powered on and in the
+      correct mode.
+
+- **Short within Pair**:
+
+  - A **Short within Pair** indicates an unintended connection within the same
+    pair of wires, typically caused by physical damage to the cable.
+
+    - **Action**: Replace or repair the cable and check for any physical damage
+      or improperly crimped connectors.
+
+- **Short to Another Pair**:
+
+  - A **Short to Another Pair** means the wires from different pairs are
+    shorted, which could occur due to physical damage or incorrect wiring.
+
+    - **Action**: Replace or repair the damaged cable. Inspect the cable for
+      incorrect terminations or pinched wiring.
+
+- **Impedance Mismatch**:
+
+  - **Impedance Mismatch** indicates a reflection caused by an impedance
+    discontinuity in the cable. This can happen when a part of the cable has
+    abnormal impedance (e.g., when different cable types are spliced together
+    or when there is a defect in the cable).
+
+    - **Action**: Check the cable quality and ensure consistent impedance
+      throughout its length. Replace any sections of the cable that do not meet
+      specifications.
+
+- **Noise**:
+
+  - **Noise** means that the Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) test could not
+    complete due to excessive noise on the cable, which can be caused by
+    interference from electromagnetic sources.
+
+    - **Action**: Identify and eliminate sources of electromagnetic
+      interference (EMI) near the cable. Consider using shielded cables or
+      rerouting the cable away from noise sources.
+
+- **Resolution Not Possible**:
+
+  - **Resolution Not Possible** means that the TDR test could not detect the
+    issue due to the resolution limitations of the test or because the fault is
+    beyond the distance that the test can measure.
+
+    - **Action**: Inspect the cable manually if possible, or use alternative
+      diagnostic tools that can handle greater distances or higher resolution.
+
+- **Unknown**:
+
+  - An **Unknown** result may occur when the test cannot classify the fault or
+    when a specific issue is outside the scope of the tool's detection
+    capabilities.
+
+    - **Action**: Re-run the test, verify the link partner's state, and inspect
+      the cable manually if necessary.
+
+**Scenarios**:
+
+  - Always take the state of the link partner into account when interpreting
+    the results. For **BaseT1** PHYs, an "OK" result usually indicates the link
+    is up and in **slave mode**. If the cable is too long (for example, in
+    **10BaseT1L** PHYs configured for short-distance mode), it might still pass
+    the test but lead to intermittent link issues.
+  - In cases where autonegotiation is used (for **Multi-Pair Ethernet**), the
+    test results may be disrupted by autonegotiation pulses, leading to a
+    "Noise" result or inaccurate reporting for pairs used for autonegotiation
+    (e.g., Pairs A and B).
+
+Verify Link Partner PHY Configuration
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+If the cable test passes but the link is still not functioning correctly, it’s
+essential to verify the configuration of the link partner’s PHY. Mismatches in
+speed, duplex settings, or master-slave roles can cause connection issues.
+
+- **Autonegotiation Mismatch**:
+
+  - If both link partners support autonegotiation, ensure that autonegotiation
+    is enabled on both sides. A mismatch can lead to connectivity problems or
+    performance degradation.
+
+  - **Quick Fix:** Reset autonegotiation to the default settings, which will
+    advertise all default link modes:
+
+  .. code-block:: bash
+
+    ethtool -s <interface> autoneg on
+
+  - **Command to check configuration:** `ethtool <interface>`
+
+  - **Expected Output:** Ensure that both sides advertise compatible link
+    modes. If autonegotiation is off, verify that both link partners are
+    configured for the same speed and duplex.
+
+    Example:
+
+  .. code-block:: bash
+
+    Settings for eth0:
+       Supported link modes:  1000baseT/Full, 100baseT/Full
+       Advertised link modes: 1000baseT/Full
+       Speed: 1000Mb/s
+       Duplex: Full
+       Auto-negotiation: on
+
+- **Combined Mode Mismatch (Autonegotiation on one side, Forced on the other)**:
+
+  - One of the most common issues occurs when one side is using
+    **autonegotiation** (as in most modern systems), and the other side is set
+    to a **forced link mode** (e.g., older hardware with single-speed hubs). In
+    such cases, modern PHYs will attempt to detect the forced mode on the other
+    side. If the link is established, you may notice:
+
+    - **No or empty "Link partner advertised link modes"**.
+
+    - **"Link partner advertised auto-negotiation:"** will be **"no"**.
+
+  - This type of detection does not always work reliably:
+
+    - If the link partner with the forced mode switches speed, the modern PHY
+      may not always detect the change correctly.
+
+    - Typically, the modern PHY will default to **Half Duplex**, even if the
+      link partner is actually configured for **Full Duplex**.
+
+  - **Action**: Set both sides to the same fixed speed and duplex mode to avoid
+    potential detection issues.
+
+  .. code-block:: bash
+
+    ethtool -s <interface> speed 1000 duplex full autoneg off
+
+- **Master/Slave Role Mismatch (BaseT1 and 1000BaseT PHYs)**:
+
+  - In **BaseT1** systems (e.g., 1000BaseT1, 100BaseT1), link establishment
+    requires that one device is configured as **master** and the other as
+    **slave**. A mismatch in this master-slave configuration can prevent the
+    link from being established. However, **1000BaseT** also supports
+    configurable master/slave roles and can face similar issues.
+  - **Role Preference in 1000BaseT**: The **1000BaseT** specification allows
+    link partners to negotiate master-slave roles during autonegotiation. Some
+    PHYs have hardware limitations or bugs that prevent them from functioning
+    properly in certain modes. In such cases, drivers may force these PHYs into
+    a specific role (e.g., **forced master** or **forced slave**). If both link
+    partners have the same issue and are forced into the same mode (e.g., both
+    forced into master mode), they will not be able to establish a link.
+
+  - **Action**: Ensure that one side is configured as **master** and the other
+    as **slave** to avoid this issue, particularly when hardware limitations
+    are involved. Check for any driver-related restrictions or forced modes.
+
+  - **Command to force master/slave mode**:
+
+    .. code-block:: bash
+
+      ethtool -s <interface> master-slave forced-master speed 1000 duplex full autoneg off
+
+  - **Check the current master/slave status**:
+
+    .. code-block:: bash
+
+      ethtool <interface>
+
+    Example Output:
+
+    .. code-block:: bash
+
+      master-slave cfg: forced-master
+      master-slave status: slave
+
+  - **Hardware Bugs and Driver Forcing**: If a known hardware issue forces the
+    PHY into a specific mode, it’s essential to check the driver or hardware
+    documentation for details. Ensure that the roles are compatible across both
+    link partners, and if both PHYs are forced into the same mode, adjust one
+    side accordingly to resolve the mismatch.
+
+Monitor Link Resets and Speed Drops
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+If the link is unstable, showing frequent resets or speed drops, this may
+indicate issues with the cable, PHY configuration, or environmental factors.
+Currently, there is no unified way in Linux to directly monitor downshift
+events or link speed changes via user space tools. However, the Linux kernel
+logs provide valuable insights if the driver supports reporting downshifts or
+other link changes.
+
+- **Monitor Kernel Logs for Link Resets and Speed Drops**:
+
+  - The Linux kernel will print link status changes, including downshift
+    events, in the system logs. The message typically includes speed changes,
+    duplex mode, and downshifted link speed (if the driver supports it).
+  - **Command to monitor kernel logs in real-time:**
+
+    .. code-block:: bash
+
+      dmesg -w | grep "Link is Up\|Link is Down"
+
+  - Example Output (if a downshift occurs):
+
+    .. code-block:: bash
+
+      eth0: Link is Up - 100Mbps/Full (downshifted) - flow control rx/tx
+      eth0: Link is Down
+
+    This indicates that the link has been established but has downshifted from
+    a higher speed.
+
+  - **Note**: Not all drivers or PHYs support downshift reporting, so you may
+    not see this information for all devices.
+
+- **Check Link Status and Speed**:
+
+  - Even though downshift counts or events are not easily tracked, you can still
+    use `ethtool` to manually check the current link speed and status.
+
+  - **Command:** `ethtool <interface>`
+
+  - **Expected Output:**
+
+    .. code-block:: bash
+
+      Speed: 1000Mb/s
+      Duplex: Full
+      Auto-negotiation: on
+      Link detected: yes
+
+    Any inconsistencies in the expected speed or duplex setting could indicate
+    an issue.
+
+- **Disable Energy-Efficient Ethernet (EEE) for Diagnostics**:
+
+  - **EEE** (Energy-Efficient Ethernet) can be a source of link instability
+    due to transitions in and out of low-power states. For diagnostic purposes,
+    it may be useful to **temporarily** disable EEE to determine if it is
+    contributing to link instability. This is **not a generic recommendation**
+    for disabling power management.
+
+  - **Action**: Disable EEE and monitor if the link becomes stable. If
+    disabling EEE resolves the issue, report the bug so that the driver can be
+    fixed.
+
+  - **Command:**
+
+    .. code-block:: bash
+
+      ethtool --set-eee <interface> eee off
+
+    - **Important**: If disabling EEE resolves the instability, the issue
+      should be reported to the maintainers as a bug, and the driver should be
+      corrected to handle EEE properly without causing instability. Disabling
+      EEE permanently should not be seen as a solution.
+
+- **Monitor Error Counters**:
+
+  - While some NIC drivers and PHYs provide error counters, there is no unified
+    set of PHY-specific counters across all hardware. Additionally, not all PHYs
+    provide useful information related to errors like CRC errors, frame drops,
+    or link flaps. Therefore, this step is dependent on the specific hardware
+    and driver support.
+
+  - **Action**: Use `ethtool -S <interface>` to check if your driver provides
+    useful error counters. In some cases, counters may provide information about
+    errors like link flaps or physical layer problems (e.g., excessive CRC
+    errors), but results can vary significantly depending on the PHY.
+
+  - **Command:** `ethtool -S <interface>`
+
+  - **Example Output (if supported)**:
+
+    .. code-block:: bash
+
+      rx_crc_errors: 123
+      tx_errors: 45
+      rx_frame_errors: 78
+
+  - **Note**: If no meaningful error counters are available or if counters are
+    not supported, you may need to rely on physical inspections (e.g., cable
+    condition) or kernel log messages (e.g., link up/down events) to further
+    diagnose the issue.
+
+When All Else Fails...
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+So you've checked the cables, monitored the logs, disabled EEE, and still...
+nothing? Don’t worry, you’re not alone. Sometimes, Ethernet gremlins just don’t
+want to cooperate.
+
+But before you throw in the towel (or the Ethernet cable), take a deep breath.
+It’s always possible that:
+
+1. Your PHY has a unique, undocumented personality.
+
+2. The problem is lying dormant, waiting for just the right moment to magically
+   resolve itself (hey, it happens!).
+
+3. Or, it could be that the ultimate solution simply hasn’t been invented yet.
+
+If none of the above bring you comfort, there’s one final step: contribute! If
+you've uncovered new or unusual issues, or have creative diagnostic methods,
+feel free to share your findings and extend this documentation. Together, we
+can hunt down every elusive network issue - one twisted pair at a time.
+
+Remember: sometimes the solution is just a reboot away, but if not, it’s time to
+dig deeper - or report that bug!

+        pairs, reducing the effectiveness of signal twisting.
+      - **Symptoms**: Increased crosstalk, higher error rates, and intermittent
+        link drops, particularly at higher speeds like 1000BASE-T.
+      - **Detection**: Cable testers can detect split pairs, and error counters
+        in the PHY may provide an indication.
+
+Environmental and External Factors
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+- **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)**:
+
+  - **Description**: External electromagnetic fields can interfere with Ethernet
+    signals, particularly in unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables.
+  - **Symptoms**: Increased transmission errors, reduced speed, or intermittent

+  - **Detection**: Error counters in the PHY or signal quality indicators (SQI)
+    may help diagnose EMI issues.
+
+- **Environmental Factors**:
+
+  - **Description**: External environmental conditions such as temperature
+    extremes, moisture, UV exposure, or mechanical stress can degrade the cable
+    or connectors, leading to signal degradation.
+  - **Symptoms**: Increased error rates, intermittent connectivity, or link

+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+- **Use of Incorrect Cable Type**:
+
+  - **Description**: Using a cable that doesn’t meet the required standards for
+    a specific Ethernet mode (e.g., using CAT5e for 10GBASE-T) or improper
+    shielding.
+  - **Symptoms**: Reduced link speed, increased errors, or no link.
+  - **Detection**: PHY diagnostics such as SQI and cable testers can help detect
+    cable quality issues.
+
+  - **Related Issue**:
+
+    - **Shielding Problems**: Improper or incomplete attachment of the shield

+
+Pair Assignment Issues in Multi-Pair Link Modes
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Ethernet standards that use **two or more pairs** of wires - such as
+**10BASE-T**, **100BASE-TX**, **1000BASE-T**, and higher - require correct pair
+assignments for proper operation. Incorrect pair assignments can cause
+significant network problems, especially as data rates increase.
+
+Multi-Pair Link Modes
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+- **Applicable Ethernet Standards**:
+
+  - **10BASE-T** (10 Mbps Ethernet)
+  - **100BASE-TX** (Fast Ethernet)
+  - **1000BASE-T** (Gigabit Ethernet)
+  - **2.5GBASE-T**, **5GBASE-T**, **10GBASE-T**
+
+Pin and Pair Naming Conventions
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+In Ethernet troubleshooting, understanding pin, pair, and color-coding
+conventions is essential, especially when physical cable repairs are necessary.
+One major challenge arises in the field when a damaged cable pair needs to be
+identified and fixed without the ability to replace the entire cable. While
+Linux diagnostics typically only provide pair names (e.g., "Pair A"), these
+names do not directly map to the color codes commonly used for cable
+identification in the field.
+
+To further complicate the issue, different standards—such as **TIA-568** and
+**IEEE 802.3**—use varying conventions for assigning pins to pairs, and pairs
+to color codes. For example, the pair names reported in diagnostics must be
+translated into physical wire colors, which differ between **TIA-568A** and
+**TIA-568B** layouts. This translation process is crucial for accurately
+identifying and repairing the correct cable pair.
+
+Although Linux diagnostic tools provide valuable information, their focus on
+pair names can make it challenging to map these names to the physical cable
+layout, particularly in fieldwork where color-coded wires are the primary means
+of identification. This section aims to highlight this problem and provide
+enough background on pin, pair, and color-coding conventions to assist with
+analyzing and addressing these issues. While this guide may not fully resolve
+the difficulties, it offers important context to help bridge the gap between
+diagnostics and physical cable repair.
+
+TIA-568 Pair and Pin Assignments
+""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
+
+The **TIA-568** standard defines two wiring schemes for terminating twisted
+pair Ethernet cables: **T568A** and **T568B**. Each scheme assigns wire colors
+and pair numbers to specific pin numbers on the RJ45 connector.
+
+There are multiple opinions available online about why T568A and T568B
+co-exist. However, according to the **TIA/EIA-568-B.2-2001** specification, no
+explanation is provided for the existence of both variants. The only additional
+information found is that:
+
+- **T568A** is recommended by the U.S. Federal Government as the standard
+  wiring scheme, as noted in the specification.
+
+The specification does not provide any specific reasoning for the use of
+**T568B**. Both schemes are considered electrically equivalent and acceptable
+for telecommunications installations.
+
+Additionally, per TIA/EIA-568-B.2-2001, there is no formal definition of
+crossover cabling for T568A or T568B. The specification states: "Because of
+their identical pair groupings, patch cords terminated in either T568A or T568B
+may be used interchangeably, provided that both ends are terminated with the
+same pin/pair scheme."
+
+Due to the coexistence of these standards, it presents an additional challenge
+for in-field repair attempts. Repair technicians must be aware of which
+standard is in use to avoid mixing pin-to-pair assignments. Misinterpreting the
+information provided by Linux diagnostic tools can result in incorrect
+identification of the pairs. This could lead to technicians mistakenly opening
+or modifying the wrong pair, potentially increasing the time needed for repairs
+and causing further connectivity issues.

+IEEE 802.3 Pair and Pin Assignments
+"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
+
+The **IEEE 802.3** standard specifies the Medium Dependent Interface (**MDI**)
+pinouts for various Ethernet physical layers. Below are the pin assignments for
+different Ethernet standards, including both MDI and MDI-X configurations where
+applicable. **MDI-X** is often associated with crossover configurations, and
+the signal names in MDI and MDI-X modes reflect whether the pair is used for
+transmit (TX), receive (RX), or bidirectional communication (BI for
+bidirectional data).
+
+In Ethernet connections, **PHYs cannot be used directly in a one-to-one
+connection** without switching the pair connections. This pair switching can be
+done either:
+
+- **Externally by the cable/connector layout** (commonly referred to as a
+  crossover cable), or
+- **Internally by the PHY**, where one device operates in **MDI** mode and the
+  other in **MDI-X** mode.
+
+If the pair switching is done externally (with a crossover cable), both PHYs
+will be in the **same mode** (both in MDI or both in MDI-X). If the switching
+is not done externally, one PHY must be in **MDI** mode, and the other in
+**MDI-X** mode to ensure proper communication between the devices.
+
+It is important to note that IEEE 802.3 does not provide pin-to-color mapping,
+and pin-to-pair mapping has evolved over time. For example, older link types
+like **10BASE-T** or **100BASE-TX** did not have official pair names.

+
+Summary of Pair Assignment Issues
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+Miswired Pairs
+""""""""""""""
+
+- **Description**: Miswired pairs occur when the wire pairs are connected to
+  the wrong pins in the connector. While this can lead to link failures, modern
+  PHYs are often capable of handling such cases as long as the pairs follow the
+  pair assignment conventions of the standards being used.
+
+  - If direct cables are used with identical pin assignments on both ends,
+    modern PHYs can detect this and automatically switch one side to **MDI**
+    mode and the other to **MDI-X** mode. Most modern PHYs offer diagnostics to
+    indicate whether **MDI** or **MDI-X** mode is in use and allow a choice
+    between automatic or forced MDI/MDI-X modes.
+  - **Older hardware**, such as old hubs, often lacked automatic switching
+    capabilities. These devices had predefined configurations: "Normal" mode
+    (MDI) for client devices like PCs or printers, and "Uplink" mode (MDI-X)
+    for connecting between hubs. Such setups required manually ensuring the
+    correct cable type was used (e.g., straight-through or crossover).
+
+- **Mixed or Incompatible Crossover Pin/Pair Assignments**:
+
+  - Miswiring or incorrect crossover configurations can result in various
+    failure modes depending on the link speed. For example, if one end of a
+    cable uses **T568A** and the other end uses **T568B** (creating a crossover
+    connection), this may work for **10BASE-T** and **100BASE-TX**, but will
+    fail for **1000BASE-T**.
+  - This is because in **1000BASE-T**, all four pairs (A, B, C, and D) are
+    used, and the mixed configuration would result in Pairs A and B being
+    crossed while Pairs C and D remain straight, causing a communication
+    breakdown.
+
+- **Detection**:
+
+  - Modern PHYs often have the ability to detect miswired pairs and may provide
+    diagnostic information indicating whether the device is operating in
+    **MDI** or **MDI-X** mode.
+  - Cable testers can also be used to identify miswiring issues, especially in
+    cases where automatic MDI/MDI-X switching is not functioning or supported.
+    Old hubs or other legacy equipment that lack automatic MDI/MDI-X
+    functionality may exhibit connectivity problems in such cases.
+
+Split Pairs
+"""""""""""
+
+**Split Pairs** occur when the two wires of a twisted pair (e.g., **TX+** and
+**TX−**) are incorrectly placed in different pairs within the cable. Instead of
+being twisted together, they are paired with wires from other pairs. Twisting
+is essential because it cancels out electromagnetic interference, ensuring
+signal integrity.
+
+- **Description**: A split pair happens when the wires that should form a pair
+  are misconnected so that they end up in different pairs, usually due to
+  improper wiring. This disrupts the twisting effect that minimizes crosstalk
+  and interference.
+
+  - **Example**: In a correctly wired Ethernet cable, the two wires of Pair A
+    (Pins 1 & 2) are twisted together. In a split pair, one wire from Pair A is
+    twisted with a wire from Pair B (Pins 3 & 6), significantly degrading
+    signal integrity.
+
+- **Symptoms**:
+
+  - **Increased crosstalk and interference**: Without proper twisting,
+    electromagnetic interference increases, leading to a higher error rate.
+
+  - **Reduced link speed**: The link may fall back to a lower speed, especially
+    at higher data rates like **1000BASE-T**, where all pairs are used.
+
+  - **Link failure at higher speeds**: While split pairs may still allow
+    **10BASE-T** or **100BASE-TX** to function, they usually cause failures at
+    **1000BASE-T** or higher due to the increased sensitivity to interference.
+
+  - **Intermittent connectivity**: Split pairs can cause intermittent link
+    drops due to signal degradation.
+
+- **Detection**:
+
+  - **Cable testers**: Advanced cable testers can detect split pairs by
+    checking if the wires in each pair are twisted together correctly.
+
+  - **Error Counters**: Monitoring error counters, such as CRC errors, can help
+    identify issues caused by split pairs, especially at higher speeds where
+    interference is more problematic.
+
+  - **Link Drop Counters**: Frequent link drops may indicate split pairs,
+    particularly if they are affecting higher-speed links like **1000BASE-T**.
+
+Polarity Reversal within Pairs
+""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
+
+- **Description**: Polarity reversal happens when the positive and negative
+  wires within a pair are swapped (e.g., **TX+** and **TX−** reversed). This
+  can happen during improper termination or incorrect pin assignments.
+
+- **Modern PHYs**: Many modern PHYs have automatic polarity detection and
+  correction features, allowing them to adjust for this issue without any
+  manual intervention. This ensures that even if the polarity within a pair is
+  reversed, the link can still establish and function correctly. - Polarity
+  detection indicators are specified for both **multi-pair** and **single-pair
+  Ethernet** variations, such as in the **MultiGBASE-T** standards. - However,
+  this feature may not be present in older PHYs, leading to potential failures
+  or degraded performance if polarity reversal occurs.
+
+- **Older Hardware**: Older devices without automatic polarity correction may
+  fail to establish a link or exhibit reduced performance if polarity reversal
+  occurs within the pairs.
+
+- **Detection**: Polarity reversal can be detected using PHY diagnostics or
+  cable testers. Advanced diagnostics in modern PHYs can indicate the polarity
+  status of each pair.
+
+Linux Kernel Recommendations for Improved Diagnostic Interfaces
+---------------------------------------------------------------
+
+As of **Linux kernel v6.11**, several improvements could be implemented to
+enhance the diagnostic capabilities for Ethernet connections, particularly for
+twisted pair Ethernet variants. These recommendations aim to address gaps in
+diagnostics for OSI Layer 1 issues and provide more detailed insights for users
+and developers.
+
+This list will evolve with future kernel versions, reflecting new features or
+refinements. Below are the current suggestions:
+
+Unified PHY Error Counters and SQI Interface for Multi-Pair Ethernet (MPE)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+- **Problem:**
+
+  - Currently, PHY driver authors have the freedom to implement various
+    PHY-supported counters, and the names of these counters often vary based on
+    specific PHY documentation. This lack of standardization creates challenges
+    for automated diagnostics and makes step-by-step troubleshooting guides
+    inconsistent, as different counters may have different names across PHYs.
+  - Additionally, while the **Signal Quality Indicator (SQI)** interface
+    exists, it was primarily designed for **Single Pair Ethernet (SPE)** use
+    cases and supports only one channel. This interface does not extend to
+    **Multi-Pair Ethernet (MPE)** variants, which need multi-channel support.
+
+- **Recommendation:**
+
+  - Introduce a **unified interface for PHY error counters** with predictable,
+    standardized counter names that can be consistently referenced across
+    different drivers and PHY implementations. This will ensure that error
+    counters are universally accessible and allow for more reliable automated
+    diagnostics and step-by-step guides.
+  - Extend the existing **SQI interface** to support **multi-pair Ethernet
+    (MPE)** use cases by enabling **multi-channel SQI reporting**. For MPE,
+    each pair/channel should have its own SQI value, allowing for better
+    diagnostics in environments using higher-bandwidth Ethernet connections
+    such as **1000Base-T** or **10GBase-T**, where multiple pairs carry
+    bidirectional data.
+
+- **Rationale:**
+
+  - A unified interface for error counters would make it easier for tools like
+    `ethtool` to provide consistent diagnostic output across different PHYs,
+    improving both manual and automated diagnostics.
+  - Extending the SQI interface to support multiple channels for MPE would
+    significantly improve diagnostics for higher-speed Ethernet variants,
+    providing more granular data about signal quality across all pairs. This
+    would make it possible to detect and isolate issues affecting specific
+    pairs, which is crucial in environments where bandwidth and performance are
+    critical.
+
+Improved Granularity for Cable Test Results with Hardware-Specific Quirks
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+- **Problem:**
+
+  - The granularity of cable testing is often limited by the specific hardware
+    (PHY) implementation, particularly with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR)
+    variations. Some PHYs may struggle to differentiate between certain states,
+    such as:
+
+    - **Open Circuit** and **Link Partner Powered Down** (link partner is
+      powered down, but the cable is intact).
+    - **OK** and **Cable Too Long** (link is functional but exceeds the maximum
+      supported cable length for the PHY).
+
+  - Additionally, certain PHYs or link modes, such as **Base-T1** variants, may
+    require the link partner to be in **forced slave mode** for the cable test
+    to yield reliable results. If the link partner is in **forced master
+    mode**, test results might not be usable.
+
+- **Recommendation:**
+
+  - Introduce a mechanism to report **hardware-specific quirks** or potential
+    **diagnostic variations** in cable test results. This could be done via
+    additional **flags or metadata** in the kernel-to-user space interface,
+    notifying user space tools (e.g., `ethtool`) about specific quirks in the
+    PHY's diagnostic capabilities. These flags could include:
+
+    - **PHY_CABLE_OPEN_OR_PARTNER_DOWN**: Notifies that the PHY cannot reliably
+      distinguish between an open circuit and the link partner being powered
+      down or in a low-power state.
+    - **PHY_CABLE_OK_ON_LENGTH_WARNING**: Indicates that the PHY reports the
+      cable as OK, but the actual cable length exceeds the PHY's supported
+      limit, potentially causing performance issues.
+    - **PHY_CABLE_TEST_PARTNER_REQUIRED_SLAVE_MODE**: Suggests that the link
+      partner needs to be in **forced slave mode** for a reliable cable test.
+      If the local PHY is in **forced slave mode**, the partner is likely in
+      **forced master mode**, making the cable test results unreliable if the
+      link partner is up.
+
+- **Potential Flags:**
+
+  - **PHY_CABLE_OPEN_OR_PARTNER_DOWN**: For cases where the PHY cannot
+    differentiate between an open circuit or a link partner that is powered
+    down.
+  - **PHY_CABLE_OK_ON_LENGTH_WARNING**: Indicates that the test reported the
+    cable as OK, but the length is approaching or exceeding limits, potentially
+    causing future performance issues.
+  - **PHY_CABLE_TEST_PARTNER_REQUIRED_SLAVE_MODE**: Suggests that for accurate
+    results, the link partner must be in forced slave mode; otherwise, the test
+    may be unreliable if the link partner is in master mode.
+
+- **Rationale:**
+
+  - By providing this additional layer of information, user space tools can
+    offer more context to users, helping them understand whether the diagnostic
+    results may be influenced by hardware-specific limitations or link
+    configurations. This would improve the accuracy and trustworthiness of
+    diagnostic output, particularly in cases where the limitations of a
+    specific PHY might otherwise obscure the real issue.
+  - Standardizing these flags ensures that user space tools provide clearer
+    diagnostics across different hardware implementations, improving
+    troubleshooting efficiency and reducing unnecessary repair attempts.
+
+Master/Slave Role Mismatch Detection
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+- **Problem:**
+  Master/slave role mismatch occurs when both link partners are configured in
+  incompatible roles (e.g., both set to master or both to slave), preventing
+  link establishment. This issue is especially relevant in BaseT1 modes and
+  other Ethernet standards that support configurable roles. However, detecting
+  such a mismatch requires specific PHY hardware capabilities, which are not
+  universally available.
+
+- **Recommendation:**
+
+  For PHYs capable of detecting and reporting a role mismatch, introduce a flag
+  in the `ethtool` UAPI under the link state reporting interface. If a role
+  mismatch is detected, it should be reported through:
+
+  - **ETHTOOL_LINK_EXT_STATE_ROLE_MISMATCH**: A new flag to indicate that a
+    role mismatch has been detected by the PHY, based on the comparison of the
+    local role configuration and the expected role of the link partner.
+
+- **Rationale:**
+
+  While the current kernel exposes local role configurations (e.g., through
+  `ethtool`), detecting and reporting role mismatches in real-time requires
+  support from the PHY hardware. For PHYs with this capability, implementing
+  this flag allows for quicker diagnostics of role mismatches, helping users
+  and administrators identify and resolve the issue without manually checking
+  role configurations on both ends. This also minimizes potential downtime due
+  to misconfigurations.
+
+Link Speed Downshift Status Indicator
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+- **Problem:**
+
+  - While a downshift counter might indicate a reduction in link speed, what
+    would be more helpful is a **flag** or **status interface** that indicates
+    whether the link could potentially operate at a higher speed, but is
+    currently downshifted due to physical layer issues.
+
+- **Recommendation:**
+
+  - Introduce a **downshift status flag** in the kernel and expose it through
+    `ethtool`. This flag should indicate whether the link is running below the
+    maximum possible speed due to issues like cable quality, interference, or
+    excessive length.
+
+- **Rationale:**
+
+  - This would allow users to quickly diagnose that something is limiting their
+    link speed without needing to monitor for downshift events. The presence of
+    this flag would signal a potential issue with the cable or environment that
+    needs further investigation.
