Yes, the expectation is that somebody else didn't take an access to the
page/data to send it off somewhere else between page_frag_alloc_va()
and page_frag_alloc_abort(), did you see expectation was broken in that
patch? If yes, we should fix that by using page_frag_free_va() related
API instead of using page_frag_alloc_abort().

As my understanding, I am not trading off branching for not having to
use virt_to_page, the branching is already needed no matter we utilize
it to avoid calling virt_to_page() or not, please be more specific about
which branching is traded off for not having to use virt_to_page() here.

So the your suggestion changed to something like below?

int page_frag_alloc_pfrag(struct page_frag_cache *nc, struct page_frag *pfrag);

The API naming of 'page_frag_alloc_pfrag' seems a little odd to me, any better
one in your mind?
