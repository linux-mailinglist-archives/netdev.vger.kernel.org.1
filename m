Yes, I totally agree.  For now, unix socket binding requires to create
the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SOCK right, but connecting to an existing
socket is not controlled.  The abstract unix socket scoping is
orthogonal and extends Landlock with unix socket LSM hooks, which are
required to extend the "filesystem" access rights to control path-based
unix socket.

Right, that should be part of the next series.  Tests should check that
too.

In this case, I think we should have a (light) Landlock domain for a
user session to make sure apps only connect to the legitimate X11 socket
(either in the same domain, or through a path-based socket).

There is also ongoing work to restrict socket creation according to their
type:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240524093015.2402952-1-ivanov.mikhail1@huawei-partners.com/
This will make possible to control abstract unix socket creation and
avoid this kind of issue too.
