It's a good point.

First, I think that vmpressure implementation is not the best
and we might want to switch to PSI (or something else) there.
This is why I'm resistant to exposing implementation-specific
metrics.

That said, I believe that some level of customization here is justified.
Maybe opting out completely is too much, but in the end it's hard for
the kernel to balance the importance of e.g. page cache vs networking
buffers as it might be really workload-dependent. Or some workloads
would prefer to risk being oom-killed rather than to tolerate a sub-par
networking performance.

Thanks!
