A small update from my side:

I had a short look into the issue today, but I've found that I don't quite =
grasp the (lack of)
locking in the m_can driver. The m_can_classdev fields active_interrupts an=
d irqstatus are accessed
from a number of=C2=A0different contexts:

- active_interrupts is *mostly* read and written from the ISR/hrtimer callb=
ack, but also from
m_can_start()/m_can_stop() and (in error paths) indirectly from m_can_poll(=
) (NAPI callback). It is
not clear to me whether start/stop/poll could race with the ISR on a differ=
ent CPU. Besides being
used for ndo_open/stop, m_can_start/stop also happen from PM callbacks.
- irqstatus is written from the ISR (or hrtimer callback) and read from m_c=
an_poll() (NAPI callback)

Is this correct without explicit sychronization, or should there be some lo=
cking or atomic for these
accesses?

Best regards,
Matthias
