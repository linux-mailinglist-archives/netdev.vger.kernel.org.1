Meanwhile two more reports came it for this issue. And I became aware of
two more for the other Luiz mentioned. I noticed my chance that Fedora
became impatient and picked up both fixes.

Linus, FWIW, in case you just those:

That one is a2ce7481010a32 ("Bluetooth: btusb: Fix not being able to
reconnect after suspend") in -next and 4084286151fc91 in the PR above.
It was posted as
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20241014202326.381559-1-luiz.dentz@gmail.com/,
but Luiz at least fixed the Fixes: tag before committing the fix.

>       Bluetooth: btusb: Fix regression with fake CSR controllers 0a12:0001

That one is b29d4ac729754f ("Bluetooth: btusb: Fix regression with fake
CSR controllers 0a12:0001") in -next and 2c1dda2acc4192 in the PR above.
It was posted here:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20241016154700.682621-1-luiz.dentz@gmail.com/
(not sure if there were any modifications afterwards).
