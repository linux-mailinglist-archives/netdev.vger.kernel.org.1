It's a known issue that disabling certain ASPM states can result
in the the system not reaching deeper package power saving states.
It has been reported several times, especially for notebooks and
mini-pc servers, where users try to keep energy consumption at a
minimum. It's a tradeoff which ASPM states to enable, and one of
the reasons why ASPM states can be controlled from user space.

The RTL8168 NIC family has a long history of ASPM issues.
Partially it also seems to depend on the host system chipset.
Root cause isn't known, Realtek doesn't provide datasheets
or errata information.
