Hi Conor and BjÃ¶rn,

Thanks for your explanation. I totally agree with what you said, 
"CONFIG_RISCV_ISA_ZBB only controls whether optimizations for Zbb are 
built so that if Zbb is detected they can be used.".

Since the instructions emited by bpf jit are in kernel space, they 
should indeed be aligned in this regard.

PS: It's a bit difficult to understand this,ðŸ˜… if I'm wrong please don't 
hesitate to tell me.
