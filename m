Yes, you are right. For my specific use case the switch is used mostly as port
multiplayer.

I'm still thinking about best way to classify DSA user port traffic.
Will it be enough to set classid on user port?

tc filter add dev lan0 protocol all flower skip_hw \
    action classid 1:1
tc filter add dev lan1 protocol all flower skip_hw \
    action classid 1:2

And then process it on the conduit port:
# Add HTB Qdisc on the conduit interface
tc qdisc add dev conduit0 root handle 1: htb default 1

# Define rate-limiting classes
tc class add dev conduit0 parent 1: classid 1:1 htb rate 100mbit burst 5k
tc class add dev conduit0 parent 1: classid 1:2 htb rate 100mbit burst 5k

Or the classid will not be transferred between devices and i'll need to
use something like skbedit?
