This is sounding like a driver bug. When phy_start() is called it
kicks off the PHY state machine. That should result in
phy_config_aneg() being called. That function is badly named, since it
is used both for autoneg and forced setting. The purpose of that call
is to configure the PHY to the configuration stored in
phydev->advertise, etc. So if the PHY by hardware defaults has autoneg
disabled, but the configuration in phydev says it should be enabled,
calling phy_config_aneg() should actually enabled autoneg. It is
possible there is a phylib bug here, because we try to not to kick off
autoneg if it is not needed, because it is slow. I've not looked at
the code, but it could be we see there is link, and skip calling
phy_config_aneg()? Maybe try booting with the cable disconnected so
there is no link?

Assuming bug free code.

I would say there are two different issues here.

1) It seems like we are not configuring the hardware to match phydev.
2) We are overwriting how the bootloader etc configured the hardware.

2) is always hard, because how do we know the PHY is not messed up
from a previous boot/crash cycle etc. In general, a driver should try
to put the hardware into a well known state. If we have a clear use
case for this, we can consider how to implement it.
