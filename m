Please kindly allow me share this information with you,


Dear Beloved, Life is gradually passing away from me as a result of my present medical condition, i'm battling with lung cancer and my personal doctor confided in me yesterday that I have only a few more weeks to live. In view of this setback, I want to donate my estate for humanitarian assistance, since this has always been the plan of my late husband and besides I have no child also with the current refugee crisis around the world. In an effort to compliment the good work of our creator for humanity and the wish of my late Husband I donate the sum of £10,000,000.00 GBP (Ten Million GBP) to you. Upon your acknowledgement of this email and informing me of your nationality and current place of resident, my Bank will facilitate due processes for transfer of this legacy to you. May God bless you as you use this money judiciously for the work of charity to help the less privileged. I intend for you to retain 40% of the funds for your commitment and sacrifice to make this possible. Thank you

Sincere regards, 

Ms. Melvida Bullock
