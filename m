Heh, yes, my apologies for being rather dense, I was not interpreting
the comment or the thread you linked properly... :(

That is super subtle :/ I can understand what the comment is warning
about with that extra context. I see Arnd's suggestion which may fix
this problem and get rid of the warning but if there are other ideas, I
am all ears. I guess we could just disable -Wcast-function-type-strict
for this code since s390 does not support kCFI right now but since it
could, it seems better to resolve it properly.

Thanks a lot for the quick review and catching my mistake, cheers!
