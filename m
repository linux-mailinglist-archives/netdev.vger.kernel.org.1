It mostly has to do with the arbitration between them. It is a matter
of having to pass a TON of info to the individual slice and then the
problem is it would have to do things correctly and not manage to take
out it's neighbor or the BMC.

We have control of the auto negotiation as that is north of the PMA
and is configured per host. We should support clause 73 autoneg.
Although we haven't done much with it as most of our use cases are
just fixed speed setups to the switch over either 25G-CR1, 50G-CR2,
50G-CR1, or 100G-CR2. So odds are we aren't going to be doing anything
too terribly exciting.

As far as the QSFP setup the FW is responsible for any communication
with it. I suspect that the expectation is that we aren't going to
need much in the way of config since we are just using direct attach
cables. So we are the only one driving the PCS assuming we aren't
talking about power-on init where the FW is setting up for the BMC to
have access.

We will have to see. The PCS drivers in that directory mostly make
sense to me and don't look like too much of a departure from my
current code. It will just be a matter of splitting up the fbnic_mac.c
file and adding the PCS logic as a separate block, or at least I hope
that is all that is mostly involved. Probably take me a week or two to
get it coded up and push out the v2.
