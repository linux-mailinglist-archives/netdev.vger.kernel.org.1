In page_pool_item_unmap(), it will return early when pool->mp_priv is
set no matter pool->dma_map is set or not, that was why I had the above
paragraph in the commit message.

The question seems to be about whether net_devmem_unbind_dmabuf() might
be called after driver has already unbound as it seems to be doing the
DMA unmapping operation based on the device of netdev->dev.parent, and
page_pool doesn't seems to have direct calling of net_devmem_unbind_dmabuf()
related API.

I am not able to find who and where is seting the netdev->dev.parent, but
I guess the DMA API is also not allowed to be called on the device of
netdev->dev.parent when the networking driver has unbound?
