Can I suggest change in the process?
1. Perform validation before posting
2. Intel will post their patches to the netdev@ ML.
3. Tony will collect reviewed patches from netdev@
4. Tony will send clean PRs (without patches) from time to time to
netdev maintainers for acceptance.

It will allow to all of us (Intel, Nvidia e.t.c) to have same submission
flow without sacrificing open netdev@ review which will be done only once.

Jakub/Dave, is it possible?

Thanks
