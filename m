No - itâ€™s a different type of device.

Esterror returns the last error to the master clock that the device
synchronizes to.
In the case of PPS - is the last error registered on the top of the second.
In the case of PTP - the last error is calculated based on a transaction.

AFIR, this comment was relevant to measuring errors coming from delays
inside the system.

If functions are isolated then there is no path for passing the messages
other than through the device.
The trusted function that can control the clock will push the last error
and control the clock to synchronize it as best as it can, other
functions will get the time from the clock and additional info to
calculate the uncertainty.

Not really. Why would all userspace processes need to understand what
synchronizes the time currently and talk to the relevant tool?
All it cares is what the time is and the primitives for calculating
error boundaries and understand if the clock is synchronized good enough
for a given application.

Also there is one more use case I missed in that summary:
4. Device need to consume the information about the uncertainty to act
upon it. This is the case when you want to allow certain features to
work only if error boundaries requirements are met. For example you
don't want to allow launch time to work when the error of the clock is
huge, as your packets will launch precisely at unprecise time.

The current adjtime() API call without any flags can fill the time of
day and the last frequency correction. At the same time, the API's timex
structure consists of many other helpful information that are not
populated for PTP hardware clocks. This information consist of esterror
field which is there since kernel 0.99.13k. I'm not inventing a new API,
just trying to add hooks to implement existing APIs inside the PTP
subsystem.
