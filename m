... and it's been delayed because I've had to rework three of the
patch series I recently posted.

I did get some time late last night to read through the documentation
I have for one version of the dwmac which has optional PCS, and I'm
coming to the conclusion that the whole mac_interface vs phy_interface
thing is wrong in the driver.

My comment update which added this a few years ago:

        /* MAC ----- optional PCS ----- SerDes ----- optional PHY ----- Media
         *       ^                               ^
         * mac_interface                   phy_interface
         *
         * mac_interface is the MAC-side interface, which may be the same
         * as phy_interface if there is no intervening PCS. If there is a
         * PCS, then mac_interface describes the interface mode between the
         * MAC and PCS, and phy_interface describes the interface mode
         * between the PCS and PHY.
         */

appears to be incorrect. It was based on just phylink knowledge and a
reasonable guess about what was going on with this driver. It seems
no one had any better ideas on exactly what mac_interface was trying
to describe.

Having looked at the information I now have, and referred back to the
psat code, it appears to me that what is actually going on here is
this:

	MAC --- optional integrated PCS --- SerDes --- world (media or PHY)
                                         ^          ^
                                 mac_interface  phy_interface
				        TBI      1000base-X

It seems that TBI is used on the PCS output when talking to a SerDes
for 1000BASE-X or SGMII. RTBI is used with a PHY that can talk RTBI.

Considering just 2.5G and below, it seems to me that mac_interface
can be determined from phy_interface:

phy_interface		mac_interface
SGMII			TBI
1000BASE-X		TBI
2500BASE-X		TBI
RTBI			RTBI

These are the "official" modes. There is also a seperate block that
is used for SMII and RGMII which the code treats as a PCS (partly
because it uses the same registers) so I'd throw into this:

phy_interface		mac_interface
SMII			SMII
RGMII*			RGMII*

For every other phy_interface <= 2.5G, mac_interface is basically
not applicable, and we should be referring to phy_interface everywhere.

In fact, I can't see that mac_interface actually matters for most of
the driver. The only case I can see it matters is when the core
supports multiple interfaces, and needs to be configured appropriately
(which needs an entire core-wide reset if it changes.)

So, I'm going to propose at the very least selecting whether the driver
uses the PCS not based on mac_interface as the code currently does, but
on phy_interface (actually the interface passed by phylink.) That will
make phylink happier when stmmac is converted to phylink_pcs.

This means I need to spend some time reworking my series... and yay,
more patches to add to my already massive stack of stmmac patches. :/
