lib/ has had SHA-1 support since 2005.  The recent changes just made the
SHA-1 API more comprehensive and more widely used in the kernel.

If calling code would like to choose not to use or allow a particular
crypto algorithm when fips_enabled=1, it's free to do so.  

That's far more flexible than the crypto/ approach, which has
historically been problematic since it breaks things unnecessarily.  The
caller can actually do something that makes sense for it, including:

- Deciding whether FIPS requirements even apply to it in the first
  place.  (Considering that it may or may not be implementing something
  that would be considered a "security function" by FIPS.)

- Targeting the disablement to the correct, narrow area.  (Not something
  overly-broad like the entire IPv6 stack, or entire TPM support.)

So: if the people doing FIPS certifications of the whole kernel make a
determination that fips_enabled=1 kernels must not support IPv6 Segment
Routing with HMAC-SHA1 authentication, then they're welcome to send a
patch that makes seg6_genl_sethmac() reject SEG6_HMAC_ALGO_SHA1 if
fips_enabled.  And that would actually correctly disable the SHA-1
support only, rather than disabling the entire IPv6 stack...

Still, for many years lib/ has had APIs for SHA-1 and various
non-FIPS-approved crypto algorithms.  These are used even when
fips_enabled=1.  So, if this was actually important, one would think
these cases would have addressed already.  This is one of the reasons
why I haven't been worrying about adding these checks myself.

It's really up to someone who cares (if anyone does) to send patches.

As I've said in another thread
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20250917184856.GA2560@quark/,
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20250918155327.GA1422@quark/),
small patches that add FIPS pre-operational self-tests would generally
be fine, if they are shown to actually be needed and are narrowly scoped
to what is actually needed.  These would be different from and much
simpler than the KUnit tests, which are the real tests.

But again, it's up to someone who cares to send patches.  And again,
lib/ has had SHA-1 since 2005, so this isn't actually new.
