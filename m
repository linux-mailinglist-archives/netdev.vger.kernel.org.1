Yes, by residency I'm referring to the package power saving state.

W/o ASPM L1 the SoC doesn't change power states, yes.
With ASPM L1 the SoC changes power states. But for the L1
substates, L1.1 could cause tx timeouts as per 90ca51e8c654 ("r8169:
fix ASPM-related issues on a number of systems with NIC version from
RTL8168h". So L1 (and L1.1) couldn't be simply turned back on without the
possibility of running into these tx timeouts. I never observed them while
I experimented and tested with L1 and L1.1.

I think some of my previous comments have been misleading.
The actual problem is that the SoC doesn't change power states.

intel_pmc_core INT33A1:00: CPU did not enter SLP_S0!!!

In the case of the system I observed the problem, there is an
EC, separate from the SoC, which will trigger the system to resume
if following a suspend there is no power state transition
detected after a period of time. That's why I was mentioning
"can't suspend" but actually is a "can't achieve s0ix" problem.

I searched for s0ix problems, I found:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D207893
and it looks similar. What do you think ?

Somehow not having L1 enabled makes it that the PCI controller
have a state that doesn't meet the criteria to transition to s0ix.
