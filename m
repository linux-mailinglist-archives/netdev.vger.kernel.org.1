Clearly not as there's been no discussion beyond my response to Andrew.
I don't know what to suggest, as whatever decision we make here, we
will have to live with the consequences of it for a very long time.

I suspect no one really knows the answer, so given the lack of
engagement on the issue, my suggestion would be to just press ahead
with your current approach.
