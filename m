There are of course some parameters of EEE that should be fixed, and
IEEE specifies them in that section. These are Ts, Tq and Tr, and IEEE
gives a range of values for these which need to be conformed with in a
compliant implementation.

Please don't get confused by the mvneta/mvpp2 implementation, there are
parameters for Ts and Tw, but the Ts value is not the same as Ts in
IEEE. IEEE defines it as the period of time between the PHY transmitting
sleep and turning all transmitters off. Marvell define it as the minimum
time from the Tx FIFO being empty to asserting LPI - quite different!

Other parameters depend on the implementation, such as the propagation
delay of data through the PHY. These, we don't currently take account
of. I don't recall off-hand whether there's any standards defined
registers describing these parameters in the PHY (I need to delve into
802.3...) That's all needed for computing Tw.

One can only make a set of defaults that depend on the speed if we also
give the user the ability to set the tx_lpi_timer values on a per-speed
basis, otherwise how do we update the values when set_eee() gets called?

Also how do we know what the requirements of the remote PHY are? I think
the only way that could be known is by exchanging the EEE TLV with the
link partner as described in section 78.

I have been aware of it, and to me it sounds like another can of worms
that right now I'd rather not open until we have solved the basics of
EEE and got MAC drivers into better shape for the basics. I had been
wondering whether we would eventually need phylink to pass Tw along
with the LPI timer, and I think eventually we would need to - and we
also need some infrastructure for the EEE TLV, both sending it at the
appropriate time, and processing it when received. I don't think we
have any of that at the moment, so it would be another chunk of
development.
