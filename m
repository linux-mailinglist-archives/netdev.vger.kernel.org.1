That feels crazy.

If you add a new device in the tree, it HAS to work properly with the
driver core (i.e. life cycles are unique, you can't have empty release
functions, etc.)  Put it on the proper bus it belongs to, bind the
needed drivers to it, and have it work that way, don't make a "fake"
device for no good reason.
