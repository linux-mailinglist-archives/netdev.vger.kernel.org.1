"Good faith" is not a sufficient foundation for a community consisting
of volunteers, and commercial entities (with the xz debacle maybe even
less today than it was a month ago). As a maintainer I really don't want
to be in position of judging the "good faith" of corporate actors.

Please allow the community to make rational choices in the interest of
the project and more importantly the interest of its broader user base.

Google would also claim "good faith" -- undoubtedly is supports 
the kernel, and lets some of its best engineers contribute.
Did that make them stop trying to build Fuchsia? The "good faith" of
companies operates with the limits of margin of error of they consider
rational and beneficial.

I don't want to put my thumb on the scale (yet?), but (with my
maintainer hat on) please don't use the "Meta is good" argument, because
someone will send a similar driver from a less involved company later on
and we'll be accused of playing favorites :( Plus companies can change
their approach to open source from "inclusive" to "extractive" 
(to borrow the economic terminology) rather quickly.
