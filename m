The DMA descriptor carries the information on the destination port.
There is no additional header required in the packet.

Agree that switchdev is the right model for this device. We were
planning to enable base Ethernet functionality using regular
(non-switchdev) netdevice representation for the ports initially,
without offload support. As the next step, L2/VLAN offload support using
switchdev will be enabled on top. Hope this phased approach is fine.

The MII Rx/Tx clocks are supplied from the NSS clock controller to the
PCS's MII channels. To represent this in the DTS, the PCS node in the
DTS is configured with the MII Rx/Tx clock that it consumes, using
macros for clocks which are exported from the NSS CC driver in a header
file. So, there will be a compile-time dependency for the dtbindings/DTS
on the NSS CC patch series. We will clearly call out this dependency in
the cover letter of the PCS driver. Hope that this approach is ok.

Sure, thanks for the inputs.
