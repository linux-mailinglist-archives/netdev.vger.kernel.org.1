Breaking valid use cases even for a short period is still no way to go.
Sorry, Jamal. Since I can't convince you, please ask Linus.

Also, I don't see you have proposed any long term solution. If you
really have one, please state it clearly and provide a clear timeline to
users.

Please read the above specific example. It is more than just valid, it
is very reasonable, installing netem for each queue is the right way of
using netem duplication to avoid the global root spinlock in a multiqueue
setup.

Breaking users and letting them complain is not a good strategy either.

On the other hand, thanks for acknowledging it breaks users, which
confirms my point.

I will wait for Linus' response.

I seriouly doubt the urgency of those CVE's, because none of them can be
triggered without root. Please don't get me wrong, I already fixed many of
them, but I believe they can wait, false urgency does not help anything.

Please avoid personal attacks. It helps nothing to your argument here,
in fact, it will only weaken your arguments.

Sure, no one's patch is perfect. I am open to improve any of my patch.
First, let's discard this user-breaking patch for disatractions and
start focusing other solutions (not necessarily mine).

If it could help you, I can set the author to be you. I have no interest
to take any credit out of here, the reason why I sent out a patch is only
because you asked me to help.

I never agreed with you on breaking users, to me it is out of table for
discussion. Just to clarify.

> on just netem, what is the point of this whole long discussion really?

To defend users, obviously.

> We have spent over a month already..

Sorry to hear that, I think you are going to a wrong direction. The
earlier you switch to a right direction, the sooner we will have a right
solution without breaking any users.

Once again, please let me know how I specifically can help you out of
this situation. I am here to solve problems, not to bring one.

(If you need a video call for help, my calendar is open.)

Thanks for your understanding!
