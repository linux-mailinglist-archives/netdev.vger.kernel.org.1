You don't have to sell me on the reuse advantages of open source. I
will probably look at adding autoneg at some point in the future, but
for our main use case it wasn't needed. If nothing else I will
probably hand it off to one of the new hires on the team when I get
some time.

The counters are exported. Just haven't gotten far enough to show the
ethtool patches yet.. :-)

Again, for us it ends up not having much value adding additional QSFP
logic because we aren't using anything fancy. It is all just direct
attach cables.

I'll probably get started on the PCS drivers for this next week. I
will follow up with questions if I run into any issues.
