Because each host must also have a valid IP route to the peerâ€™s RoCE IP address to create RC QP. If the IP route used is the same IP Route as the associated TCP/IP connection, the reuse of the IP routing topology could be achieved.

During the first contact processing, the Mac address of the next hop IP address for the IP route is resolved by performing e.g. ARP and used to create the RoCEv2 RC QP. If the route is not usable for the RoCE IP address to reach the peer's RoCE IP address i.e. without this restriction, the UDP/IP packets would not be transported in a right way.

Because at the end of the CLC handshake(TCP/IP traffic), the first link will be created by sending and receiving LLC confirm message (SMCRv2 traffic). If one peer can just send but not receive the LLC confirm message, he will send CLC decline message with the reason "Time Out".

The optimized configuration looks much more reasonable to me. Thus, why 
do we need to do the symmetric check when the server is direct route? 
Don't we expect for a direct route on the client's side? If not, I have 
to repeat my question: does it make any sense that the peers communicate 
with each other with different IP routing topology structures, like your 
first version of configuration? If yes, I need convincing argument.

Thanks,
