ok, so i need to define descriptions for all interrupts instead of only 
increasing the count. Ok, was not clear to me.

so something like this:

item0: on SoCs with shared IRQ (mt762[18]) used for RX+TX, on other free 
to be used
item1: on non-shared SoCs used for TX
item2: on non-shared SoCs used for RX (except RSS/LRO is used)
item3: reserved / currently unused
item4-7: IRQs for RSS/LRO

MT7988 is basicly new because there is no devicetree there yet...only 
driver and
this (incomplete) binding.

i thought i can limit is by setting the MaxItems in the soc-spcific 
blocks below.
What reason does MaxItems have there if not this? of course if there is 
any Soc not
having a specific block it is open.But this is also the case for 
interrupts property
handles the same way before.

I only left it open on mt7988 (only set minitems because all 8 can be 
used, but 4 are required).

The original binding excluded the 4 RSS/LRO IRQs as this is an optional 
feature not
yet available in driver. It is needed to get the full speed on the 10G 
interfaces.
MT7988 is the first SoC which has 10G MACs. Older Socs like mt7986 and 
mt7981 can also
support RSS/LRO to reduce cpu load. But here we will run into the "new 
kernel - old
devicetree" issue, if we try to upstream this. Maybe we do not add this 
because these
only have 2.5G MACs.

if i upstream the ethernet-node now with only 4 IRQS, we have to extend 
them later and
have to deal with only 4 IRQs in driver to be compatible with older DTS. 
So newer
kernel with RSS/LRO support cannot work with older DT.
To avoid this i add all related IRQs now (from DT perspective a new 
device - there is
no mt7988 device with ethernet node in devicetree yet).

i tried to explain :(
i have a working dts for mt7988 and try to upstream it in this series 
and thats the
cause i have to update the binding. Imho i cannot increase the 
interrupt-count in SoC
specific block (e.g. setting count globally to 4 but to 8 for only 
mt7988).

I added interrupt-names to get it cleaner in driver (access via name 
instead of
index). And also in Devicetree we see the meaning of IRQs without 
looking through
driver. I see really no reason for not adding the interrupt names.
