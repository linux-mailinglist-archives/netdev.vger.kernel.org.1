[+cc Rafael in case you have suspend debug help]

Can we push on this a little bit?  The fact that suspend fails is
super interesting to me.  I'd like to know exactly how this fails and
whether it's in the kernel or in firmware.  If we're violating some
assumption firmware is making, maybe there would be a more generic
fix.

How exactly do you suspend?  Is there any debugging output you can
collect while doing that?  Maybe [1] has hints.  I see a bunch of
trace_suspend_resume() calls, and I think they're connected to [2],
which looks like it might generate console/dmesg output, but I don't
know how to enable that.
