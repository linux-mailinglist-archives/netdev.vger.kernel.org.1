Sure and thanks for pushing it further!

Up to you. It was useful during working on on the syscall side, but
I understand that it's an unnecessary complication.

Yeah, agreed, I think it was a leftover from my some other non-rcu
attempt.

That should work as well as long as we can bind multiple sockets.
Maybe that's even better because it avoids xa_load on every sendmsg,
so go for it.

That should work as well, I haven't spent a ton of time polishing that
part. Note that in my tests, I saw half throughput with this API+udmabuf
vs regular MSG_ZEROCOPY. So it's either my sloppy locking, xa_load
or iovec parsing. Or something else, idk :-)
