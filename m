O.K, so its a mess :-(

Lets look at this from a different direction. Which stable kernels do
you actually care about? Is 6.6 enough for you? Do you need 6.1? 4.19?

You should use a Fixed tag which goes back far enough for you. The
patch itself might not apply that far back, but once you get it merged
and backported as far as it does go, you can submit ported versions
for older kernel, referencing the original fix commit hash number.
