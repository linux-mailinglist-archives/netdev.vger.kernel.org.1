Thanks, noted, we will incorporate it to the next version.

As of now, socket pressure throttling can be disabled by moving 
processes, causing the pressure, into the root cgroup. So we would 
definitely benefit from disabling it more idiomatically.

This bpftrace output is captured from a production server using nginx 
proxy (the left-most column is a timestamp in nanoseconds) which we use 
as a HTTP cache. As you can see, it fluctuates a lot.

We believe that the issue originates from suboptimally chosen constants, 
as seen in [1]. Currently, the vmpressure triggers when it cannot 
reclaim a few MiB of memory on a server that has over 500 GiB of memory.

Link: 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.17.1/source/mm/vmpressure.c#L38 [1]

We would like to work on that more after this patch to try to find a 
better constant or at least make it _more configurable_ if that makes 
sense for you.

Thanks!
Daniel
