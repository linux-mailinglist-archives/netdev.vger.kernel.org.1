I do not intend to violate the regulations of the RGMII standard and aim 
to maintain the same delay across all speeds. But the RX programming 
swap bit can only introduce a delay of 180 degrees. Should I assume the 
1G speed clock to calculate and determine if this bit should be enabled 
for all speeds?
