It absolutely is designed for an obsolete form of hardware offload.  Have you
ever tried actually using it?  Here's how to hash a buffer of data with shash:

	return crypto_shash_tfm_digest(tfm, data, size, out)

... and here's how to do it with the SHA-256 library, for what it's worth:

	sha256(data, size, out)

and here's how to do it with ahash:

	struct ahash_request *req;
	struct scatterlist sg;
	DECLARE_CRYPTO_WAIT(wait);
	int err;

	req = ahash_request_alloc(alg, GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!req)
		return -ENOMEM;

	sg_init_one(&sg, data, size);
	ahash_request_set_callback(req, CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_SLEEP |
					CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG,
				   crypto_req_done, &wait);
	ahash_request_set_crypt(req, &sg, out, size);

	err = crypto_wait_req(crypto_ahash_digest(req), &wait);

	ahash_request_free(req);
	return err;

Hmm, I wonder which API users would rather use?

The extra complexity is from supporting an obsolete form of hardware offload.

Yes, skcipher and aead have the same problem, but that doesn't mean it is right.

What?  GHASH is a polynomial hash function, so it is easily parallelizable.  If
you precompute N powers of the hash key then you can process N blocks in
parallel.  Check how the AES-GCM assembly code works; that's exactly what it
does.  This is fundamentally different from message digests like SHA-* where the
blocks have to be processed serially.
