So this indicates any board might need this feature, not just this one
board. Putting the board name in the driver then does not scale.

O.K. Now look at how other boards tune their delays. There are
standard properties for this:

        rx-internal-delay-ps:
          description:
            RGMII Receive Clock Delay defined in pico seconds. This is used for
            controllers that have configurable RX internal delays. If this
            property is present then the MAC applies the RX delay.
        tx-internal-delay-ps:
          description:
            RGMII Transmit Clock Delay defined in pico seconds. This is used for
            controllers that have configurable TX internal delays. If this
            property is present then the MAC applies the TX delay.

I think you can use these properties, maybe with an additional comment
in the binding. RGMII running at 1G has a clock of 125MHz. That is a
period of 8ns. So a half clock cycle delay is then 4ns.

So an rx-internal-delay-ps of 0-2000 means this clock invert should be
disabled. A rx-internal-delay-ps of 4000-6000 means the clock invert
should be enabled.

Now, ideally, you want the PHY to add the RGMII delays, that is what i
request all MAC/PHY pairs do, so we have a uniform setup across all
boards. So unless the PHY does not support RGMII delays, you would
expect rx-internal-delay-ps to be either just a small number of
picoseconds for fine tuning, or a small number of picoseconds + 4ns
for fine tuning.

This scales, since it can be used by an board with poor design, and it
does not require anything proprietary to Qualcomm, except the extended
range, and hopefully nobody except Qualcomms broken RDK will require
it, because obviously you will document the issue with the RDK and
tell customers how to correctly design their board to be RGMII
compliant with the clocks.
