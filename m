This is really the question for the energy model maintainers. In my
understanding, the energy model can cover any device in the system,
including GPUs. But, in my limited experience, I haven’t seen such cases
beyond CPUs.


@Lukasz — What do you think? The focus here is on the scope of the
“energy model” and its proper naming in the NETLINK.

I absolutely agree with you. Thank you for sharing your concerns and
examples.
