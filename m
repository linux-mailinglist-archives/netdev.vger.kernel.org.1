Can you verify that the problem still exists in a current kernel,
e.g., v6.9?

If this is a regression that's still present in v6.9, we need to
identify the commit that broke it.  Maybe it's 90ca51e8c654 ("r8169:
fix ASPM-related issues on a number of systems with NIC version from
RTL8168h")?

Whatever the problem is, it definitely should be fixed in the kernel,
and Ilpo is right that it *should* be done in the PCI core ASPM
support (aspm.c) or at least with interfaces it supplies.

Generally speaking, drivers should not need to touch ASPM at all
except to work around hardware defects in their device, but r8169 has
a long history of weird ASPM stuff.  I dunno if that stuff is related
to hardware defects in the r8169 devices or if it is workarounds for
past or current defects in aspm.c.

Yep, we can't assume any of that because the PCI core owns ASPM
config, not the driver itself.

As Heiner pointed out, if it's a SoC defect, it would potentially
affect all devices and a workaround would have to cover them all.
