Why so hurry ? Are you rushing for some tasks ? Please be patient.

The discussion is still ongoing, and you need to wait for everyone's 
opinions,
at least you can wait a few days to see if there are any other opinions, 
even if you think
your patch is correct.

There is no need to send a new patch. If this patch is approved, the net 
maintainer will handle it,
regardless of whether it is a change request or not.

And your new patch, I don't want to go too far, as you are a newcomer, I 
appreciate your report and
willingness to fix this issue. But it's wrong.

If you want to split them, embedding inet_sock should be the first 
patch, which is a basic logical issue.

Then, don't send patches so frequently, I'm very worried that you will 
immediately send out v6 after
seeing it.

Best wishes,
D. Wythe
