>   - Can the new timeout value be threaded through the new epoll ioctl ?
> 
>     Only with difficulty. The epoll ioctl sets options on an epoll
>     context and the NAPI ID associated with an epoll context can change
>     based on what file descriptors a user app adds to the epoll context.
>     This would introduce complexity in the API from the user perspective
>     and also complexity in the kernel.

>     gro_flush_timeout ?
> 
>     No. The problem is that the long timeout must engage if and only if
>     prefer-busy is active.
> 
>     When using NIC coalescing for the short timeout (without
>     napi_defer_hard_irqs/gro_flush_timeout), an interrupt after an idle
>     period will trigger softirq, which will run napi polling. At this
>     point, prefer-busy is not active, so NIC interrupts would be
>     re-enabled. Then it is not possible for the longer timeout to
>     interject to switch control back to polling. In other words, only by
>     using the software timer for the short timeout, it is possible to
>     extend the timeout without having to reprogram the NIC timer or
>     reach down directly and disable interrupts.
> 
>     Using gro_flush_timeout for the long timeout also has problems, for
>     the same underlying reason. In the current napi implementation,
>     gro_flush_timeout is not tied to prefer-busy. We'd either have to
>     change that and in the process modify the existing deferral
>     mechanism, or introduce a state variable to determine whether
>     gro_flush_timeout is used as long timeout for irq suspend or whether
>     it is used for its default purpose. In an earlier version, we did
>     try something similar to the latter and made it work, but it ends up
>     being a lot more convoluted than our current proposal.
> 
>   - Isn't it already possible to combine busy looping with irq deferral?
> 
>     Yes, in fact enabling irq deferral via napi_defer_hard_irqs and
>     gro_flush_timeout is a precondition for prefer_busy_poll to have an
>     effect. If the application also uses a tight busy loop with
>     essentially nonblocking epoll_wait (accomplished with a very short
>     timeout parameter), this is the fullbusy case shown in the results.
>     An application using blocking epoll_wait is shown as the napibusy
>     case in the result. It's a hybrid approach that provides limited
>     latency benefits compared to the base case and plain irq deferral,
>     but not as good as fullbusy or suspend.

>   - Patch 1 rewritten to use netdev-genl instead of sysfs.
>   - Patch 3 updated with a comment added to napi_resume_irqs.

>   - Patch 6 updated the kernel documentation.

The series looks good, thank you both for pushing this!
