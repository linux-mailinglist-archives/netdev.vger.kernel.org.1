Please name things as per the 802.3 spec, although "based on" suggests
it isn't strictly to the 802.3 spec... I don't have a recent enough spec
to be able to check yet.

I guess what you're saying here is that 802.3 LAUI-2 is NRZ, whereas
your LAUI is PAM4 ? Please nail this down properly, is your LAUI
specific to your implementation, or is it defined by 802.3?

So, 100GBASE-R is four lanes, 100GBASE-P is two or one lane using PAM4,
right?

Much of these translations are based on documentation rather than
testing, especially for speeds >10G. Adding the faster speeds helps
avoid a stream of patches as people test other modules, unless the
spec is actually wrong.

Electrically, a SFP cage only has a fixed number of pins, and only has
sufficient to support one lane. As such, I'm not sure it makes sense to
add the >1 lane protocols to phylink_sfp_interfaces. I think if we want
to do that, we need to include the number of lanes that the cage has at
the use sites.
