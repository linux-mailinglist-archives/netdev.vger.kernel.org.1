And this as: "Challenges with DSA: uses Ethernet". I think we can all
agree that standard Ethernet, with all the flexibility it gives to pair
any discrete DSA switch to any host NIC, does not give us sufficient
instruments for independent flow control of each user port.

Food for thought: strongly coupled MAC + integrated DSA switch systems,
like for example Broadcom, have custom methods of pacing transmission to
user ports by selectively stopping conduit TX queues associated with
those user ports on congestion:

There are multiple, and sometimes conflicting, goals to QoS and strategies on
congestion. Generally speaking, it is good to clarify that deterministic latency,
high throughput and zero loss cannot be all achieved at the same time. It is
also good to highlight the fact that you are focusing on zero loss and that
this is not necessarily the full picture. Some AVB/TSN switches, like SJA1105,
do not support pause frames at all, not even on user ports, because as you say,
it's like the nuclear solution which stops the entire port regardless of
packet priorities. And even if they did support it, for deterministic latency
applications it is best to turn it off. If you make a port enter congestion by
bombarding it with TC0 traffic, you'll incur latency to TC7 traffic until you
exit the congestion condition. These switches just expect to have reservations
very carefully configured by the system administrator. What exceeds reservations
and cannot consume shared resources (because they are temporarily depleted) is dropped.

A splendid idea in theory. In practice, the traffic rate at the egress
of a user port is the sum of locally injected traffic plus autonomously
forwarded traffic. The port can enter congestion even with shaping of
CPU-injected traffic at a certain rate.

You _could_ apply this technique to achieve a different purpose than
net zero packet loss: selective transmission guarantees for CPU-injected
traffic. But you also need to ensure that injected packets have a higher
strict priority than the rest, and that the switch resources are
configured through devlink-sb to have enough reserved space to keep
these high priority packets on congestion and drop something else instead.

It's a tool to have for sure, but you need to be extremely specific and
realistic about your goals.

Agree that there is high complexity. Just need to see a proposal which
acknowledges that it's not for nothing.

Ok, so you propose an abstract key set for DSA in the flower classifier
with mappings to concrete packet fields happening in the backend,
probably done by the tagging protocol in use. The abstract key set
represents the superset of all known DSA fields, united by a common
interpretation, and each tagger rejects keys it cannot map to the
physical DSA tag.

I can immediately think of a challenge here, that we can dynamically
change the tagging protocol while tc rules are present, and this can
affect which flower keys can be mapped and which cannot. For example,
the ocelot tagging protocol could map a virtual DSA key "TX timestamp
type" to the REW_OP field, but the ocelot-8021q tagger cannot. Plus, you
could add tc filters to a block shared by multiple devices. You can't
always infer the physical tagging protocol from the device that the
filters are attached to.

The second approach that you recommend suffers from the same problem as Lorenzo's
revised proposal, which is that it treats the conduit interface as a collection of
independent pipes of infinite capacity to each user port, with no arbitration concerns
of its own. The model is again great in theory, but maps really poorly on real life.
Your proposal actively encourages users to look away from the scheduling algorithm
of the conduit, and just look at user ports in isolation of each other. I strongly
disagree with it.
