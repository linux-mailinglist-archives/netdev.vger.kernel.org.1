Hi,

The Programmable Real-Time Unit Industrial Communication Sub-system (PRU-ICSS)
is available on the TI SOCs in two flavors: Gigabit ICSS (ICSSG) and the older
Megabit ICSS (ICSSM).

Support for ICSSG Dual-EMAC mode has already been mainlined [1] and the
fundamental components/drivers such as PRUSS driver, Remoteproc driver,
PRU-ICSS INTC, and PRU-ICSS IEP drivers are already available in the mainline
Linux kernel. The current set of patch series builds on top of these components
and introduces changes to support the Dual-EMAC using ICSSM on the TI AM57xx,
AM437x and AM335x devices.

AM335x, AM437x and AM57xx devices may have either one or two PRU-ICSS instances
with two 32-bit RISC PRU cores. Each PRU core has (a) dedicated Ethernet interface
(MII, MDIO), timers, capture modules, and serial communication interfaces, and
(b) dedicated data and instruction RAM as well as shared RAM for inter PRU
communication within the PRU-ICSS.

These patches add support for basic RX and TX  functionality over PRU Ethernet
ports in Dual-EMAC mode.

Further, note that these are the initial set of patches for a single instance of
PRU-ICSS Ethernet.  Additional features such as Ethtool support, VLAN Filtering,
Multicast Filtering, Promiscuous mode, Storm prevention, Interrupt coalescing,
Linux PTP (ptp4l) Ordinary clock and Switch mode support for AM335x, AM437x
and AM57x along with support for a second instance of  PRU-ICSS on AM57x
will be posted subsequently.

The patches presented in this series have gone through the patch verification
tools and no warnings or errors are reported. Sample test logs obtained from AM33x,
AM43x and AM57x verifying the functionality on Linux next kernel are available here:

This is the v15 of the patch series [v1]. This version of the patchset
addresses the comments made on [v14] of the series.

Changes from v14 to v15 :

*) Addressed Jakub Kicinski's comments on patch 4 of the series.
*) Addressed MD Danish Anwar comments on patch 2 of the series.
*) Rebased the series on latest net-next.

Changes from v13 to v14 :

*) Addressed Jakub Kicinski's comments on patch 4 of the series.
*) Addressed MD Danish Anwar comments on cover letter of the series.

Changes from v11 to v12 :

*) Addressed Jakub Kicinski's comments on patch 2 of the series.
*) Rebased the series on latest net-next.

Changes from v10 to v11 :

*) Reduced patch series size by removing features such as Ethtool support,
VLAN filtering, Multicast filtering, Promiscuous mode handling, Storm Prevention,
Interrupt coalescing, and Linux PTP (ptp4l) ordinary clock support. This was done
based on Jakub Kicinski's feedback regarding the large patch size (~5kLoC).
