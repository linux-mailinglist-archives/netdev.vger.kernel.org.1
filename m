stack traces would be helpful.

you can add a filter on the tracepoint event to limit what is passed
(although I have not tried the filter with an ebpf program - e.g.,
reason != NOT_SPECIFIED).

This is from 2020 and I forget which kernel version (pre-BTF), but it
worked at that time and allowed userspace to summarize drop reasons by
various network data (mac, L3 address, n-tuple, etc):

sure, kfree_skb is like the raw_syscall tracepoint - it can be more than
what you need for a specific problem, but it is also give you way more
than you are thinking about today.
