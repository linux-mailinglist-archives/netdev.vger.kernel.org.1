Its the state of the state machine, not the state of the PHY. It is
already documented in kernel doc, so we don't really want to duplicate
it. So maybe just cross reference to the kdoc:

https://docs.kernel.org/networking/kapi.html#c.phy_state

I don't think 'early on' is relevant. In the kernel, you pretty much
always need the bigger picture, how a pieces of the puzzle fits in
with what is above it and what is below it. Sometimes you need to
extend what is above and below. Or a reviewer will tell you to move
code into the core, so others can share it, etc.
