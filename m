That's incorrect.  The SHA-1 library was already used by
kernel/bpf/core.c and net/ipv6/addrconf.c.  And also
drivers/char/random.c prior to 5.17.

Well, fips=1 has never had any documentation.  If anyone cares they
should document it.

But also, as I said, if certain kernel subsystem(s) mustn't use certain
algorithms when fips=1, then the people who care about FIPS are welcome
to add that logic to those subsystems.  It's trivial:

    #include <linux/fips.h>

    if (fips_enabled)
            return -EOPNOTSUPP;

Sure, it's 3 lines per subsystem, but compare that to the 50-200 that
typically gets saved by switching to the library.  And the library
solves a number of other problems too.  So it's still well worth it.

I'll plan to add these checks to MD5 uses when doing MD5 conversions in
6.19.  Yes, I didn't add them to SHA-1 uses when doing SHA-1 conversions
in 6.18, but it's clear that disallowing SHA-1 is still a
work-in-progress anyway.  I'll assume that you or someone else are going
to finish the work for SHA-1 at some point.

Again, incorrect.  Core kernel functionality uses, and continues to use,
non-FIPS-approved crypto algorithms.

Maybe the FIPS people assessed each of those use cases and determined
that they are not "security functions".  But I and other upstream kernel
developers have no visibility into that.

More likely IMO is that the FIPS people are just ignoring reality.

You're welcome to be constructive instead of obstructive.

Again: while that particular user is new, the SHA-1 library was already
used by kernel/bpf/core.c and net/ipv6/addrconf.c.

As I've said: if the pre-operational self-tests are actually needed in
lib/ after all, then lib/ can just implement the minimum that FIPS
requires, which is actually quite straightforward (typically just a
single check for algorithm).

I don't see it as duplicating the actual tests.  The way that
crypto/testmgr.c conflates the FIPS pre-operational self-tests and the
actual tests has always been really problematic.
