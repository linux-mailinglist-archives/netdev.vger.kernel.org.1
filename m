No, problem.

No need to fake it right now, you came up with nice idea to have
"configurable" method, wich in case of PD692x0 is only a single build in
method. Since user space will be ably to see available and used
prioritization methods - i'm happy with it.

Huh... good question. I assume, if we go with policy in kernel, then it
is ok to implement just some one. But, I assume, we will need this kind of
interface soon or later: 

Warning! this is discussion, i'm in process of understanding :D

/**
 * enum pse_disconnection_policy - Disconnection strategies for same-priority
 *   devices when power budget is exceeded, tailored to specific priority modes.
 *
 * Each device can have multiple disconnection policies set as an array of
 * priorities. When the power budget is exceeded, the policies are executed
 * in the order defined by the user. This allows for a more nuanced and 
 * flexible approach to handling power constraints across a range of devices
 * with similar priorities or attributes.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *   - Users can specify an ordered list of policies, such as starting with
 *     `PSE_DISCON_STATIC_CLASS_HIGHEST_FIRST` to prioritize based on class,
 *     followed by `PSE_DISCON_LRC` to break ties based on connection time.
 *     This ordered execution ensures that power disconnections align closely
 *     with the systemâ€™s operational requirements and priorities.
 *
 * @PSE_DISCON_LRC: Disconnect least recently connected device.
 *   - Relevant for: ETHTOOL_PSE_PORT_PRIO_STATIC
 *   - Behavior: When multiple devices share the same priority level, the
 *     system disconnects the device that was most recently connected.
 *   - Rationale: This strategy favors stability for longer-standing connections,
 *     assuming that established devices may be more critical.
 *   - Use Case: Suitable for systems prioritizing stable power allocation for
 *     existing static-priority connections, making newer devices suitable
 *     candidates for disconnection if limits are exceeded.

 * @PSE_DISCON_ROUND_ROBIN_IDX_LOWEST_FIRST: Disconnect based on port index in a 
 *   round-robin manner, starting with the lowest index.
 *   - Relevant for: ETHTOOL_PSE_PORT_PRIO_STATIC
 *   - Behavior: Disconnects devices sequentially based on port index, starting
 *     with the lowest. If multiple disconnections are required, the process
 *     continues in ascending order.
 *   - Rationale: Provides a predictable, systematic approach for static-priority
 *     devices, making it clear which device will be disconnected next if power
 *     limits are reached.
 *   - Use Case: Appropriate for systems where static-priority devices are equal
 *     in role, and fairness in disconnections is prioritized.

 * @PSE_DISCON_ROUND_ROBIN_IDX_HIGHEST_FIRST: Disconnect based on port index in a 
 *   round-robin manner, starting with the highest index.
 *   - Relevant for: ETHTOOL_PSE_PORT_PRIO_STATIC
 *   - Behavior: Disconnects devices sequentially based on port index, starting
 *     with the highest. If multiple disconnections are required, the process
 *     continues in descending order.
 *   - Rationale: Provides a predictable, systematic approach for static-priority
 *     devices, prioritizing disconnection from the highest port number downwards.
 *   - Use Case: Suitable for scenarios where higher port numbers are less critical,
 *     or where devices connected to higher ports can be sacrificed first.

 * @PSE_DISCON_STATIC_CLASS_HIGHEST_FIRST: Disconnect based on static allocation
 *   class, disconnecting higher-class devices first.
 *   - Relevant for: ETHTOOL_PSE_PORT_PRIO_STATIC
 *   - Behavior: Disconnects devices in order of their assigned power class,
 *     with higher-class devices being disconnected first.
 *   - Rationale: This strategy can be useful in scenarios where the goal is to
 *     preserve lower-class devices for minimal essential services, possibly
 *     sacrificing higher-class, power-intensive devices.
 *   - Use Case: Fits scenarios where power classes represent power-hungry or
 *     non-essential devices, allowing essential services to continue under
 *     constrained power conditions.

 * @PSE_DISCON_STATIC_CLASS_LOWEST_FIRST: Disconnect based on static allocation
 *   class, disconnecting lower-class devices first.
 *   - Relevant for: ETHTOOL_PSE_PORT_PRIO_STATIC
 *   - Behavior: Disconnects devices in order of their assigned power class,
 *     with lower-class devices being disconnected first.
 *   - Rationale: Ensures that higher-class, more critical devices retain power
 *     during constrained conditions.
 *   - Use Case: Fits scenarios where power classes represent priority, allowing
 *     the system to maintain higher-class static devices under constrained
 *     conditions.

 * @PSE_DISCON_STATIC_CLASS_BUDGET_MATCH: Disconnect based on static allocation
 *   class, targeting devices that release enough allocated power to meet the
 *   current power requirement.
 *   - Relevant for: ETHTOOL_PSE_PORT_PRIO_STATIC
 *   - Behavior: Searches for the lowest-priority device that can release
 *     sufficient allocated power to meet the current budget requirement.
 *     Ensures that disconnection occurs only when enough power is freed.
 *   - Rationale: This strategy is useful when the goal is to balance power
 *     budget requirements while minimizing the number of disconnected devices.
 *     It ensures that the system does not needlessly disconnect multiple
 *     devices if a single disconnection is sufficient to meet the power needs.
 *   - Use Case: Ideal for systems where precise power budget management is
 *     necessary, and disconnections must be efficient in terms of freeing
 *     enough power with minimal impact on the system.

 * @PSE_DISCON_LOWEST_AVG_POWER: Disconnect device with the lowest average
 *   power draw, minimizing impact on dynamic power allocation.
 *   - Relevant for: ETHTOOL_PSE_PORT_PRIO_DYNAMIC
 *   - Behavior: Among devices with the same priority level, the system
 *     disconnects the device with the lowest average power draw.
 *   - If multiple devices have the same average power draw and priority,
 *     further tie-breaking mechanisms can be applied, such as disconnecting
 *     the least recently connected device.
 *   - Rationale: Minimizes disruption across dynamic devices, keeping as many
 *     active as possible by removing the lowest-power ones.
 *   - Use Case: Suitable for dynamic-priority systems where maximizing the
 *     number of connected devices is more important than individual device
 *     power requirements.

 * @PSE_DISCON_LONGEST_IDLE: Disconnect device with the longest idle time
 *   (low or no recent active power usage).
 *   - Relevant for: ETHTOOL_PSE_PORT_PRIO_DYNAMIC
 *   - Behavior: Disconnects the device with the longest period of inactivity,
 *     where "idle" is defined as low current draw or absence of recent data
 *     transmission.
 *   - If multiple devices have the same idle time and priority, a tie-breaking
 *     mechanism, such as round-robin based on port index, can be used.
 *   - Rationale: Optimizes resource allocation in dynamic-priority setups by
 *     maintaining active devices while deprioritizing those with minimal
 *     recent usage.
 *   - Use Case: Ideal for dynamic environments, like sensor networks, where
 *     devices may be intermittently active and can be deprioritized during
 *     idle periods.
 *
 * These disconnection policies provide flexibility in handling cases where
 * multiple devices with the same priority exceed the PSE budget, aligning
 * with either static or dynamic port priority modes:
 *   - `ETHTOOL_PSE_PORT_PRIO_STATIC` benefits from policies that maintain
 *     stable power allocation, favoring longer-standing or higher-class
 *     devices (e.g., `PSE_DISCON_LRC`, `PSE_DISCON_ROUND_ROBIN_IDX`,
 *     `PSE_DISCON_STATIC_CLASS_HIGHEST_FIRST`, `PSE_DISCON_STATIC_CLASS_LOWEST_FIRST`,
 *     `PSE_DISCON_STATIC_CLASS_BUDGET_MATCH`).
 *   - `ETHTOOL_PSE_PORT_PRIO_DYNAMIC` supports policies that dynamically
 *     adjust based on real-time metrics (e.g., `PSE_DISCON_LOWEST_AVG_POWER`,
 *     `PSE_DISCON_LONGEST_IDLE`), ideal for setups where usage fluctuates
 *     frequently.
 *   - Users can define an ordered array of disconnection policies, allowing
 *     the system to apply each policy in sequence, providing nuanced control
 *     over how power disconnections are handled.
 */

PD692x0 seems to use @PSE_DISCON_ROUND_ROBIN_IDX_HIGHEST_FIRST disconnection
policy.

ETHTOOL_PSE_PORT_PRIO_DYNAMIC and ETHTOOL_PSE_PORT_PRIO_STATIC seems to be the
source of information which should be used to trigger the disconnection policy.
Correct?
