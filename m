nitpick: except for ds->needs_standalone_vlan_filtering (which b53 does not set though).

Ok, so let's say b53_default_pvid() is 0, and b53_setup() ->
b53_apply_config() -> b53_configure_vlan() calls b53_set_vlan_entry() on
it to set it up, independently of the 8021q layer. So far so good.

But then, the 8021q layer can modify VID 0 on the device from the way in
which it was set up by the driver for VLAN-unaware operation, namely it
can remove it, and this breaks VLAN-unaware reception.

One needs to wonder why would the b53 driver even permit changes coming
from .port_vlan_add() and .port_vlan_del() to a VID it has reserved for
special use. There's nothing to gain from reacting to these operations,
only to lose.

I'm trying to think whether switchdev drivers in general have anything
to benefit from commit ad1afb003939 ("vlan_dev: VLAN 0 should be treated
as "no vlan tag" (802.1p packet)"). I'm tempted to say "thanks for the
well-intended hint about VID 0, but a switchdev's data path is so
complicated that we'd rather manage VID 0 ourselves". Not only do many
drivers reserve VID 0 and thus need to be independent of the 8021q layer
even for VLAN-unaware operation, but also think of this: the bridge may
have vlan_filtering 1 and vlan_default_pvid 0. What will happen if the
8021q layer decides to add VID 0 to the RX filtering table? My logic and
testing with the software data path says that VID 0 traffic should not
be forwarded. My intuition is that it will make b53 accept this kind of
traffic.

Here's a self test I posted exactly for this scenario, if you don't
mind, please let me know what happens, and we'll see where to go from
there. On ocelot, which has commit 9323ac367005 ("net: mscc: ocelot:
ignore VID 0 added by 8021q module"), it passes (but fails elsewhere,
sadly - I've sent a patch also for that).
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20250424223734.3096202-2-vladimir.oltean@nxp.com/T/#u

That being said, I don't think we are quite prepared to adopt my
solution (of ignoring VID 0) DSA-wide (especially not as a bug fix),
because it is driver-dependent whether VID 0 is in a conflict with a
VLAN ID reserved for private use or not. Even though adding VID 0 to the
RX filtering table possibly allows its forwarding even when it shouldn't
(and that isn't desirable), there might be some positive benefits as
well - like permitting VID 0 reception when it _should_ be received.

It's a pretty tricky situation, I guess we should first establish what
are the tests that need to pass, then assess on a per-driver basis where
we are. We don't have nearly as much coverage as we would need.
