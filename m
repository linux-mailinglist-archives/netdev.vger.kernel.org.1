That is making life easier for you, making it harder for the community.
O relevance.

Yeah, so not even we would have to maintain driver nobody (outside Meta)
uses or cares about, you say that we will likely maintain more of a dead
code related to that. I think that in Linux kernel, there any many
examples of similarly dead code that causes a lot of headaches to
maintain.

You just want to make your life easier here again. Don't drag community
into this please.

OCP, ehm, lets say I have my reservations...
Okay, what motivation would anyne have to touch the fw of a hardware
running inside Meta datacenter only? Does not make any sense.

I'd say come again when your HW is not limited to Meta datacenter.
For the record and FWIW, I NACK this.
