I don't understand the need for configuration less here. You don't have
it for the rest of the actions. Why this is special?

Perhaps it is a nice opportunity to do such mirred cleanup, prepare the
code and implement block send afterwards?

If I omit the code for now, from user perspective, this functionality
belongs into mirred, don't you think? Just replace "dev" by "block" and
you got what you need.
