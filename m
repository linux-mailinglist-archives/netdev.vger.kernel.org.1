Let me clearly state two things this thread it running around all the
time:
1) This has nothing to do with you Alex, at all. If John Doe was the one
   pushing this, from my perspective, everything would be exactly the same.
2) This is not about selling devices. I already stresses that out
   multiple times, yet people are still talking about selling. This is
   about possibility of outside-Meta person to meet the device in real
   world with real usecase (not emulated, that does not make any sense).
