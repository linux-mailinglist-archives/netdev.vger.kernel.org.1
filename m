I have to agree with Russell. You wanted comments on the dwmac1000
patches, but all you received where comments on the PHY parts. Maybe
if you had requested comments on the MAC driver changes, somebody
might of commented, but i doubt it.

RFC seems best used during the merge window, and when you know the
target audience well enough to know they will look at the patches even
when it does have RFC.
