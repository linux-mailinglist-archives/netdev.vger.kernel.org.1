Any ideas why the scan is taking so long?

For each PHY address (of which there are 32) we scan each MMD between
1 and 31 inclusive. We attempt to read the devices-in-package
registers. That means 32 * 32 * 2 calls to the mdiobus_c45_read(),
which is 2048 calls. Each is two MDIO transactions on the bus, so
that's 4096. Each is 64 bits long including preamble, and at 2.5MHz
(the "old" maximum) it should take about 100ms to scan the each
MMD on each PHY address to determine whether a device is present.

I'm guessing the MDIO driver you are using is probably using a software
timeout which is extending the latency of each bus frame considerably.
Maybe that is where one should be looking if the timing is not
acceptable?
