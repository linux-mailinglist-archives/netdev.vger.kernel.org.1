I think the problem is there are multiple maintainers and they all
have different ways of doing things. As a submitter over the years I
have had to deal with probably over a half dozen different maintainers
and each experience has been different. I have always argued that the
netdev tree is one of the better maintained setups.

I wasn't saying the driver wouldn't be dependent on existing behavior.
I was saying that it was a hypothetical that Meta would be a "less
than cooperative user" and demand a revert.  It is also a hypothetical
that Linus wouldn't just propose a revert of the fbnic driver instead
of the API for the crime of being a "less than cooperative maintainer"
and  then give Meta the Nvidia treatment.

I don't get this part. You are paranoid about bad actors until it
comes to accepting the test results? So write a broken API, "prove" it
works by running it on your broken test setup, and then get it
upstream after establishing a false base for trust. Seems like a
perfect setup for an exploit like what happened with the xz setup.

Isn't that what we are doing right now? We are basically refusing this
patch set not based on its own merits but on a "what-if" scenario for
a patch set that might come at some point in the future and conjecture
that somehow it is going to be able to add features for just itself
when we haven't allowed that for in the past, for example with things
like GSO partial.

We always do. I am not sure why you would expect that would change by
blocking this patch set. If anything it sounds like maybe we need to
document some requirements for availability for testing, and
expectations for what it would mean to be a one-off device where only
one entity has access to it. However that is a process problem, and
not so much a patch or driver issue.

Write what down? That the vendors didn't like me harassing them to
test my code so they shipped me the NICs and asked me to just test it
myself?

That worked in my scenario as I had a server level system in my home
lab to make that work. We cannot expect everyone to have that kind of
setup for their own development. That is why I am considering the QEMU
approach as that might make this a bit more accessible. I could then
look at enabling the QEMU at the same time I enable the driver.

If nothing else, maybe we need a writeup somewhere of the level of
support a driver should expect from the Linux community if the device
is not "easily available". We could probably define that in terms of
what a reasonable expectation would be for a developer to have access
to it.

I would say that "commercial sales" is not a good metric and shouldn't
come into it. If anything it would be about device availability for
development and testing.

In addition I would be good with a definition of "support" for the
case of a device that isn't publicly available being quite limited, as
those with access would have to have active involvement in the
community to enable support. Without that it might as well be
considered orphaned and the driver dropped.
