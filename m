Okay, on core changes I 100% agree. That is one of the reasons why we
have the whole thing about any feature really needing to be enabled on
at least 2 different vendor devices.

My apologies. I had interpreted your statement as essentially agreeing
with Jiri and NAKing the patches simply for not being commercially
available.

I can't say for certain if that will be the case going forward or not.
I know we haven't reached out to any distros and currently don't need
to. With that said though, having the driver available as a module
shouldn't cause any harm either so I don't really have a strong
opinion about it either way.

Seeing as how we arne't in the NIC business I am not sure how
restrictive we would be about licensing out the IP. I could see Meta
potentially trying to open up the specs just to take the manufacturing
burden off of us and enable more competition, though I am on the
engineering side and not so much sourcing so I am just speculating.

I'm assuming it is some sort of firmware functionality that is needed
to enable it? One thing with our design is that the firmware actually
has minimal functionality. Basically it is the liaison between the
BMC, Host, and the MAC. Otherwise it has no role to play in the
control path so when the driver is loaded it is running the show.

I assume you are talking about the need to have an open source
consumer for any exposed uapi? That makes sense from the test and
development standpoint as you need to have some way to exercise and
test any interface that is available in the kernel.

I didn't say how widely or when. I got my introduction to Linux by
buying used server systems and trying to get something maintainable in
terms of OS on them. From my experience you end up with all sorts of
odd-ball proprietary parts that eventually end up leaking out to the
public. Though back then it was more likely to be a proprietary spin
of some known silicon with a few tweaks that had to be accounted for.

Yeah, I think I had misunderstood your original comment as being in
support of Jiri's position. I hadn't fully grokked that you were doing
more of a "yes, but" versus an "yes, and".

For this driver I don't see there being too much in the way of
complications as there shouldn't be much in the way of any sort of
kernel-bypass that would be applicable to this driver uniquely.

Thanks,
