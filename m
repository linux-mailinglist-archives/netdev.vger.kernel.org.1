It is a bit ambiguous. RESETn is both an input and an output. It says
this about input for the For the 6352:

     As in input, when RESETn is driven low by an external device,
     this device will then driver RESETn low as an output for 8 to
     14ms (10ms typically). In this mode RESETn can be used to
     debounce a hardware reset switch.

So i would say it needs to be low long enough not to be a glitch, but
can be short.

Is you device held in reset before the driver loads? As i said, the
aim of this code is not to actually reset the switch, but to ensure it
is taken out of reset if it was being held in reset. And if it was
being held in reset, i would expect that to be for a long time, at
least the current Linux boot time.
