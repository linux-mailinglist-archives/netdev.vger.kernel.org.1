Doing an audit on today's net-next after I've fixed up another driver
for the phylib-eee fallout, we have two obvious breakages remaining
in drivers that directly use phylib:

drivers/net/ethernet/samsung/sxgbe/sxgbe_ethtool.c:

        edata->tx_lpi_timer = priv->tx_lpi_timer;

        return phy_ethtool_get_eee(dev->phydev, edata);

drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/genet/bcmgenet.c:

        e->tx_lpi_enabled = p->tx_lpi_enabled;
        e->tx_lpi_timer = bcmgenet_umac_readl(priv, UMAC_EEE_LPI_TIMER);

        return phy_ethtool_get_eee(dev->phydev, e);

Two others change ->tx_lpi_timer after calling phy_ethtool_get_eee()
and thus are unaffected:

drivers/net/ethernet/realtek/r8169_main.c:
drivers/net/usb/lan78xx.c

Howeve,r I wonder whether lan78xx_set_eee() is racy:

        ret = phy_ethtool_set_eee(net->phydev, edata);
        if (ret < 0)
                goto out;

        buf = (u32)edata->tx_lpi_timer;
        ret = lan78xx_write_reg(dev, EEE_TX_LPI_REQ_DLY, buf);

since phy_ethtool_set_eee() will have bounced the link if the timer
was changed.

I'm also wondering whether r8169 programs its LPI timer correctly.

I think all phylink using drivers network are now no longer affected.

I'm unsure about many DSA drivers. mt753x:

        u32 set, mask = LPI_THRESH_MASK | LPI_MODE_EN;

        if (e->tx_lpi_timer > 0xFFF)
                return -EINVAL;

        set = LPI_THRESH_SET(e->tx_lpi_timer);
        if (!e->tx_lpi_enabled)
                /* Force LPI Mode without a delay */
                set |= LPI_MODE_EN;
        mt7530_rmw(priv, MT753X_PMEEECR_P(port), mask, set);

Why force LPI *without* a delay if tx_lpi_enabled is false? This
seems to go against the documented API:

 * @tx_lpi_enabled: Whether the interface should assert its tx lpi, given
 *      that eee was negotiated.

qca8k_set_mac_eee() sets the LPI enabled based off eee->eee_enabled.
It doesn't seem to change the register on link up/down, so I wonder
how the autoneg resolution is handled. Maybe it isn't, so maybe it's
buggy.

b53_set_mac_eee() looks similar to qca8k_set_mac_eee().

So there's still work to be done.
