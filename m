They care, and they will jump in to fix it. There is no expectation that 
as a community member you should be able to make 100% correct patches, 
this is absolutely not humanly possible, even less so with scarce access 
to the hardware. All you can hope for is that your changes work, and 
that someone catches it, sooner rather than later.

This happens all of the time, if you make a netdev tree wide change, how 
many maintainer's Acked-by do we collect before merging those changes: 
none typically because some netdev maintainers are just quicker than 
reviewers could be. In other subsystems we might actually wait for 
people to give a change to give their A-b or R-b tags, not always though.

I was trying to appease your concerns about additional maintenance 
burden. If the burden becomes real, we ditch it. We can dismiss this 
point as being not relevant if you want.

There is no exchange of favors or "this" for "that", this is not how a 
community works. You bring your code to the table, solicit review 
feedback, then go on to maintain it within your bounds, and, time 
permitting, beyond your driver. What we gain as a community is 
additional visibility, more API users (eventually real world users, 
too), and therefore a somewhat more objective way of coming up with new 
APIs and features, and just a broader understanding of what is out 
there. This is better than speculation since that creates a less skewed 
mental model.

Let us say that someone at Meta wanted to get this core netdev feature 
that could be super cool for others included in the upstream kernel, we 
would shut it down on the basis that no user exists and we would be 
right about doing it that. Turns out there is a user, but the driver 
lives out of tree, but now we also reject that driver? Who benefits from 
doing that: nobody.

You need a membership card to join the club that you can only enter if 
you have a membership card already? No thank you.

Technically it would be both forward porting cycles, since they would no 
longer need to rebase the driver against their most recent kernel used, 
and backporting cycles for the first kernel including fbnic onwards.

That comes almost for free these days anyways thanks to static analysis 
tools. The overwhelming cost of the maintenance remains on Meta 
engineers, being the only ones with access to the hardware. If they end 
up with customers in the future, they can offload some of that to their 
customers, too.

Let's just look at a few high profile drivers by lines changed:

I admit this is simplistic because both mlxsw and mlx5 drivers helped 
greatly improve the networking stack in parts that I benefited directly 
from within DSA for instance.

The point is, you paid the maintenance price though, the community did not.

I think your opposition is unreasonable and is unfair. Using your 
argument to the extreme, I may go as far as saying that it encourages 
working out of tree, rather than in tree. This is the exact opposite of 
what made Linux successful as an OS.
