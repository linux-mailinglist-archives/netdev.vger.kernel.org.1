We like to try to understand what is going on, and give accurate
descriptions. You have given us important information here, which at
minimum should go into the commit message, but more likely, it will
help lead us to the correct fix.

So, two things here. You say:

> I think that the phylink commit is just enabling by default the EEE support,

That needs confirming, because you are blaming the conversion to
phylink, not that phylink now enabled EEE by default. Russell also
tries to avoid behaviour change, which this clearly is. We want a
better understanding what caused this behaviour change.

Also:

> - Enabling EEE manually using ethtool, triggers the problem too (and ethtool
> -show-eee report eee status enabled):

This indicates EEE has always been broken. This brokenness has been
somewhat hidden in the past, and it is the change in behaviour in
phylink which exposed this brokenness. A commit message using these
words would be much more factually correct, and it would also fit with
the Fixes: tag you used.

So, please work with Russell. I see two things which would be good to
understand before a new version of the patch is submitted:

What cause the behaviour change such that EEE is now enabled? Was it
deliberate? Should something be change to revert that behaviour
change?

Given that EEE has always been broken, do we understand it
sufficiently to say it is not fixable? Is there an errata? Are we sure
it is the PHY and not the MAC which is broken?
