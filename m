I think David muddied the waters by talking about vmsplice().  The
problem encountered is with splice() from the page cache.  Reading
the documentation,

       splice()  moves  data  between two file descriptors without copying be‚Äê
       tween kernel address space and user address space.  It transfers up  to
       len bytes of data from the file descriptor fd_in to the file descriptor
       fd_out, where one of the file descriptors must refer to a pipe.

The bug reported is actually with using FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, but a
simpler problem is:

#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define PAGE_SIZE 4096

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        int fd = open(argv[1], O_RDWR | O_CREAT, 0644);

        err = ftruncate(fd, PAGE_SIZE);
        pwrite(fd, "old", 3, 0);
        splice(fd, NULL, 1, NULL, PAGE_SIZE, 0);
        pwrite(fd, "new", 3, 0);

        return 0;
}

That outputs "new".  Should it?  If so, the manpage is really wrong.
It says the point of splice() is to remove the kernel-user-kernel copy,
and notes that zerocopy might be happening, but that's an optimisation
the user shouldn't notice.
