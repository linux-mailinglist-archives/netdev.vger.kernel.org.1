ETH level means raw packet socket which means *all* packets are duplicated.

This one I am familiar with and its filter -- the fact that the filter
applies *after* the clone means it still contributes to the packet load.

Together these 2 sockets might explain why the filter drop shows up in
packet_rcv.

Any packet socket is the problem because the filter is applied to the
clone. Clone the packet, run the filter, kfree the packet.

So this the raw packet socket at L3 that shows up. This one should not
be as large of a contributor to the increases packet load.
