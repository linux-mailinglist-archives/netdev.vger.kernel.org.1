We could cheerfully add vast amounts of code to the kernel to check for
the future addition of bugs.  But we don't do that, because it would be
insane.

Is it possible for such overflows to occur in the cred code?  If so,
that's a bug.  Can we fix that cred bug without all this overhead? 
With a cc:stable backport.  If not then, again, what is the non
handwavy, non cargoculty justification for adding this overhead to
the kernel?
