Calling get_page() / put_page() on a tail page is fine -- that just
redirects to the head page.  But calling it on a slab never made any
sense; at best it gets you the equivalent of TYPESAFE_BY_RCU -- that is,
the object can be freed and reallocated, but the underlying slab will
not be reallocated to some other purpose.

Right, that's what happened in the block layer.  We mark the bio with
BIO_PAGE_PINNED if the pincount needs to be dropped.  As a transitional
period, we had BIO_PAGE_REFFED which indicated that the page refcount
needed to be dropped.  Perhaps there's something similar that network
could be doing.
