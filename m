I agree with Arnd.  The standard practice in the kernel is for headers
to be includeable even when the associated kconfig (if any) isn't
enabled.  In such a case usually the inline functions, macros, and the
declarations of out-of-line functions and global variables are still
made available in the header.

The point of the kconfig symbol is just to build the file containing the
definitions of out-of-line functions and global variables.

Yes, when those definitions are needed and calling code forgets to
select that kconfig symbol, a build error results.  But it's "only" a
build error; those get found and fixed relatively easily.  The
alternative of hiding everything would mean a lot more #ifdefs in other
code, which ends up being very messy.
