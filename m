I'm not sure if you're interested in a proper Tested-by tag at that 
point, but I tested that series on socfpga with :

  - 1 instance using RGMII, w/ a ksz9031 PHY, and it works well, traffic 
flows, ethtool seems to report correct data

  - 1 instance that has the Lynx PCS (DMA_HW_FEATURE[30:28] == 0)

This also works perfectly, switching between SGMII/1000BaseX dynamically 
by hotswapping SFP modules works well, no regression found at a first 
glance.

I haven't had time t take a deep look at the code itself, but at least 
it works :)

Thanks,

Maxime
