I think you need to add support for saving and restoring TPH registers,
otherwise the changes you make to those registers may not survive
reset recovery or system sleep.  Granted, system sleep may not be
relevant for servers (which I assume you're targeting with your patches),
but reset recovery very much is.

Paul Luse submitted a patch two years ago to save and restore
TPH registers, perhaps you can include it in your patch set?

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220712123641.2319-1-paul.e.luse@intel.com/

Bjorn left some comments on Paul's patch:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220912214516.GA538566@bhelgaas/

In particular, Bjorn asked for shared infrastructure to access
TPH registers (which you're adding in your patch set) and spotted
several nits (which should be easy to address).  So I think you may
be able to integrate Paul's patch into your series without too much
effort.

However note that when writing to TPH registers through the API you're
introducing, you also need to update the saved register state so that
those changes aren't lost upon a subsequent reset recovery.

Thanks,

Lukas
