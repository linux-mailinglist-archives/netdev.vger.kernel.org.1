Can you use a publicly available c3 instance type instead? Maybe you
can't, and if so you should probably mention that it's an internal
c3 image and can't be reproduced on the public c3's because of XYZ
in the cover letter.

Sorry, I still don't agree. Just because your configuration won't
work for me out of the box is, IMHO, totally unrelated to what
Martin and I are asking for.

I won't speak for Martin, but I am saying that the configuration you
are using should be thoroughly documented so that I can at least
understand it and how I might reproduce it.

To the list of things to add to the cover letter:
  - What OS and version are you using?
  - How many runs of neper? It seems like it was just 1 run. Is that
    sufficient? I'd argue you need to re-run the experiment many
    times, with different message sizes, queue counts, etc and
    compute some statistical analysis of the results.

You keep referring to "your platform" and I'm still confused.

Don't you think it's important to properly document _your setup_,
including mentioning that core 2 is used for the IRQ and the
onload+neper runs on other cores? Maybe I missed it in the cover
letter, but that details seems pretty important for analysis,
wouldn't you agree?

Even if my computer is different, there should be enough detail for
me to form a mental model of what you are doing so that I can think
through it, understand the data, and, if I want to, try to reproduce
it.

I'm going to let the thread rest at this point; I just think we are
talking past each other here and it just doesn't feel productive.

You are saying that your platform and configuration are not publicly
available, there are too many "micro details", and that you can't
suggest a configuration for my computer, which is sure to be wildly
different.

I keep repeating this, but I'll repeat it more explicitly: I'm not
asking you to suggest a configuration to me for my computer.

I'm asking you to thoroughly, rigorously, and verbosely document
what _exactly_ *your setup* is, precisely how it is configured, and
all the versions and SHAs of everything so that if I want to try to
reproduce it I have enough information in order to do so.

With your cover letter as it stands presently: this is not possible.

Surely, if I can run neper and get a latency measurement, I can run
a script that you wrote which measures CPU cycles using a publicly
available tool, right? Then at least we are both measuring CPU
consumption the same way and can compare latency vs CPU tradeoff
results based on the same measurement.

By providing better documentation, you make it more likely that
other people will try to reproduce your results. The more people who
reproduce your results, the stronger the argument to get this merged
becomes.
