That's an implementation detail and you can definitely optimize it. One
possible way might be caching the state in socket at creation time which
puts some restrictions like to change the config, workload needs to be
restarted.

Your simple solution is exposing a stable permanent user facing API
which I suspect is temporary situation. Let's discuss it at the end.

Running workloads in root cgroup is not normal and comes with a warning
of no isolation provided.

I looked at the patch again to understand the modes you are introducing.
Initially, I thought the series introduced multiple modes, including an
option to exclude network memory from memcg accounting. However, if I
understand correctly, that is not the case—the opt-out applies only to
the global TCP/UDP accounting. That’s a relief, and I apologize for the
misunderstanding.

If I’m correct, you need a way to exclude a workload from the global
TCP/UDP accounting, and currently, memcg serves as a convenient
abstraction for the workload. Please let me know if I misunderstood.

Now memcg is one way to represent the workload. Another more natural, at
least to me, is the core cgroup. Basically cgroup.something interface.
BPF is yet another option.

To me cgroup seems preferrable but let's see what other memcg & cgroup
folks think. Also note that for cgroup and memcg the interface will need
to be hierarchical.
