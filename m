Well, yes and no.

There are two kernels involved in resume from hibernation: the restore
kernel that runs just like after a fresh boot except that at one point
in the boot process it attempts to load a hibernation image and (if
loading the image succeeds) jumps to the other kernel instance
included in the image, referred to as the image kernel.

For the restore kernel, devices are in the same state as after a fresh
boot (generally speaking, with some rare exceptions that are
irrelevant here IMV), but for the image kernel, they are in whatever
state the restore kernel has put them into.

Yes, but if the restore kernel has a driver for the device in
question, it may as well have initialized that device already.

In that case, the image kernel has much less to do to get the device
to work again.

The caveat is that the image kernel doesn't really know whether or not
this has been the case.

This generally is good advice, but if the platform AML is defective,
it may not be sufficient.
