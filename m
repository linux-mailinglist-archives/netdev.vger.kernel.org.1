I think it's there; that same text is in PCI r3.0, Appendix I, about
five lines before I.1.

I.3.1.1 says RV is required, and I guess it has to be last in VPD-R to
cover any reserved space (as needed, I suppose to align to the VPD-W
area, which might be in a different chip).

Yes, and I think the RV description is more specific and is what I
would have used to implement it.

Good idea, cc'd.
