No, I just did a POC and didn't find the time to improve it.
So I think we can go on with your version.

Oh, I was trying to refer to SHM(Share memory file in the userspace, see man
shm_open(3)). SMD is also OK.

I believe that if we are going to separate and refine the code, and add
a common subsystem, we should choose the most appropriate name.

In my opinion, "ISM" doesn’t quite capture what the device provides.
Since we’re adding a "Device" that enables different entities (such as
processes or VMs) to perform shared memory communication, I think a more
fitting name would be better. If you have any alternative suggestions,
I’m open to them.

I believe that if we are going to rename it, there should be no
reference to "ISM" in this subsystem. IBM's PCI ISM can retain that
name, as it is an implementation of the Shared Memory device (assuming
we adopt that name).

This works for me as well. I think it would be better to implement this
within the common ISM layer, rather than duplicating the code in each
device. Similar to how it's done in netdevice.
