That's some nice work !

I however would have like to be in CC for that, and to have gotten the
information that you were working on that.

You commented on the phy_port V10 that we were moving away from
sfp_select_interface() and at the time, I asked if the approach I was
considering for phy_port was correct or not [1].

Without any reply from you I move on and implemented some reworks in the
phy_port series, without comments from you on V11/12/13, only to find out
now that this whole thing I've added since v10 to come-up with generic
interface selection on PHY driver SFP is superseded by that work.

While your approach is definitely better, I'd have appreciated a heads-up
that you were working on that, or even be in CC: for that work, as I'm
having very limited availabilities to parse the full netdev list :(

In any case, this will make the phy_port series simpler, so thanks for
that work
