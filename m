I'm having a hard time understanding why. Here's my reasoning; please
correct me if I'm wrong?

Taking a step back, the semantics of `accept` are that, on successful
completion, it creates a new socket associated with the accepted
connection. It makes sense that such a new socket would take a
reference on the underlying device, since the socket is inherently
tied to that device; this is what Lars's patch does. Indeed, consider
the case that a connection was accepted, and then the bound listening
socket was immediately closed, thus dropping the reference on the
device: it seems that adding a reference onto the device in the
`accept` path is necessary.

So how does `ax25_release` get called? That ends up getting invoked
from `close`; I traced this through the kernel from `sys_close` until
the invocation of the `.release` function from the `proto_ops` vector.
The call graph looks something like this:

sys_close (fs/open.c)
 -> file_close_fd (fs/file.c)
  -> file_closed_fd_locked(same)
  <- returns struct file to file_close_fd
 <- returns struct file to sys_close
 -> filp_flush (fs/open.c)
  -> ops vec `.flush` (nop for socket)
 -> __fput_sync (fs/file_table.c):  decref(f_count) =3D> __fput
  -> __fput (fs/file_table.c)
   -> fsnotify_close(file) (irrelevant)
   -> f_op->release
    -> sock_close (net/socket.c)
     -> __sock_release (net/socket.c)
      -> proto_ops vec `.release`
       -> ax25_release (net/ax25/af_ax25.c)

There may be other ways it's invoked, but that's likely the main one.
It seems clear that this will happen for sockets that have a ref on
the device either via `bind` or via `accept`.

I'm not sure that's true. It looks to me like the ref is dropped when
the accepted socket is eventually closed. What am I missing?

I agree that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but I'm
not sure I follow the reasoning behind their being a leak. It's not
clear to me that Lars's patch is obviously wrong. I _do_ think this
code hasn't been shown much love in a long time, and I am totally
prepared to admit that I'm wrong, but right now, I don't see it?
