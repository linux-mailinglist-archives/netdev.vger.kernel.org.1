Does it? I don't think so. If you break something, better try to fix it
before somebody else has to.

So? That is not my point. If I break something in fbnic, why does anyone
care? Nobody is ever to hit that bug, only Meta DC.

Realistically, did you see that ever happen. I can't recall.

You are talking about a flow that does not exist. I don't understand how
is that related to this discussion then.

I don't see any favor for the community. What's the favor exactly?
The only favor I see is the in the opposite direction, community giving
Meta free cycles saving their backporting costs. Why?


>about their intentions and the future.

Heh, the intention is pretty clear from this discussion, isn't it? If
they ever by any chance decide to go public with their device, driver
for that could be submitted at a time. But this is totally hypothetical.
