Because you seem to be implying that the Meta NIC driver shouldn't be
included simply since it isn't going to be available outside of Meta.
The fact is Meta employs a number of kernel developers and as a result
of that there will be a number of kernel developers that will have
access to this NIC and likely do development on systems containing it.
In addition simply due to the size of the datacenters that we will be
populating there is actually a strong likelihood that there will be
more instances of this NIC running on Linux than there are of some
other vendor devices that have been allowed to have drivers in the
kernel.

So from what I can tell the only difference is if we are manufacturing
this for sale, or for personal use. Thus why I mention "commercial"
since the only difference from my perspective is the fact that we are
making it for our own use instead of selling it.

Really? So would you be making the same argument if it was
Nvidia/Mellanox pushing the driver and they were exclusively making it
just for Meta, Google, or some other big cloud provider? I suspect
not. If nothing else they likely wouldn't disclose the plan for
exclusive sales to get around this sort of thing. The fact is I know
many of the vendors make proprietary spins of their firmware and
hardware for specific customers. The way I see it this patchset is
being rejected as I was too honest about the general plan and use case
for it.

This is what I am getting at. It just seems like we are playing games
with semantics where if it is a vendor making the arrangement then it
is okay for them to make hardware that is inaccessible to most, but if
it is Meta then somehow it isn't.
