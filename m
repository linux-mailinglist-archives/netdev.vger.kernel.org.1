Yes.

Basically Yes. I actually think the first sentence is not 100%
correct. It could be all the package configuration registers are in
the base address, without an actual PHY. The PHYs then follow at
addresses above it. I can also imagine a case where the first PHY in
the package is not used, so its not listed at all. So i think it
should be "We often have a PHY node with the same address of the PHY
package node."

The description you give is that there are two SERDES, and both could
be connected to a MAC. What does package-phy-mode represent then? 

Luo Jie patch for the qca8084 seems to have the same issue. It has two
SERDES/PMA, and both could be connected to the MACs. So it seems like
QCA devices don't actually fit this model. If we want to describe the
package link mode, we probably need to list each PMA, and have a
property in the PMA node indicating what link mode the PMA is
operating at.

At least for the moment, its not clear we actually need this at
all. It seems like the phy-mode is all we need. The PHY driver should
know what values are valid per port, and so can validate the value.

We do need a compatible for the package. The kernel is unlikely to use
it, but the validation tools will. Each package can have its own DT
properties, so we need a .yaml to describe those properties. So i
would expect to have a "qca807x-package" compatible, which then lists
the tx driver strength etc. The PHYs within the package don't need
compatible, they are just linux PHYs, probed using the same code as
PHYs outside of a package.
