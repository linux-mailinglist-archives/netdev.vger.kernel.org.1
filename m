Is DMA part of the abstract model? That would suggest a true shared
memory system is excluded, since that would not require DMA.

Maybe take a look at subsystems like USB, I2C.

usb_submit_urb(struct urb *urb, gfp_t mem_flags)

An URB is a data structure with a block of memory associated with it,
contains the detail to pass to the USB device.

i2c_transfer(struct i2c_adapter *adap, struct i2c_msg *msgs, int num)

*msgs points to num of messages which get transferred to/from the I2C
device.

Could the high level API look like this? No DMA, no IRQ, no concept of
a somewhat shared memory. Just an API which asks for a message to be
sent to the other end? struct urb has some USB concepts in it, struct
i2c_msg has some I2C concepts in it. A struct ism_msg would follow the
same pattern, but does it need to care about the DMA, the IRQ, the
memory which is semi shared?
