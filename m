Ack, i'm working right now on the standardized PHY stats. With some work on
kernel side it would be possible to get with something like this:
ethtool -S eth1 --all-groups

This will be cool. I was thinking about netlink notification for some
health issues, to avoid polling on the user side.

This would be nice, but this is too much work. Last week I was porting lan78xx
to PHYlink. Plain porting is some hours of work, the 80% of time is
testing and fixing different issues. I do no think there are enough
resources to port all of drivers.

Sounds good, introduce the helper and rename net->phydev to something
different. This should explode everything what is using net->phydev
directly.

I assume, even with stacked PHYs, some kind of power management would
be needed. The WoL is probably less interesting, since all attached PHYs are
under linux control, so we can suspend or resume them.

The EEE on other hand, may help to reduce run time power consumption.
Still, it the user space should know about it, since it may be critical
for time critical tasks.

I guess, we would need some kind of PHY related metadata. For example,
MAC triggered EEE, would add some latency, but should work fine with
PTP. PHY backed EEE (like SmartEEE, etc) would add latency and affect
PTP if time stamps are made by the MAC and not by the PHY. All of this
information is HW specific. But, I assume, it is not withing the scope
of your current work.
