Different story. The driver is still the same. Perhaps only some parts
of it are tailored to fit one person's need, maybe. But here, the whole
thing is obviously is targeted to one person. Can't you see the scale on
which these are different?

Could you please describe in details and examples what exactly is we
are about to loose? I don't see it.
