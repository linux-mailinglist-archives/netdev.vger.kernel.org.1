No, that's not a problem. During reset the pinctrl/gpio controller is always
reset to the default and no matter how the pins were used in Linux before the
reset. Hence debug output and also emrgency download mode always works.
The only disadvantage of use the pins differently is that the bootrom output
on one of them cannot be prevented -- but in case that's not a problem (eg.
because the pin is later used as an input rather than output) it can totally
be done, though it would be stupid as it would render the debug UART unusable.
Yet, I'd consider it a possible choice of a board designer.

So this criteria, avoiding unnecessary duplication, is also what I thought and
is very true for the argument I presented before which somehow wasn't what has
convinced you: That using uart0 in any possible way **always** implied using
the uart0 pingroup in uart mode, because there aren't any other pins which can
be used for uart0. In this sense, if uart0 is used at all, it is **not** the
choice of the board designer which pins to use for that -- there simply is only
that one single option.

That's exactly my point: There isn't any other option to route uart0 to. Only
those two pins. The other alternative functions of those pins (apart from GPIO)
are rather esoteric debugging features (I2C access to SoC internals).

So the choice of a HW engineer regarding uart0 is simply whether uart0
is used or not. If uart0 is used, the HW engineer doesn't have any choice
regarding which pins they would like to use for the uart0 RX and TX lines,
the SoC design dictates exactly one option for that.

Thank you, that should make it clear to Sjoerd as well (who may skip and ignore
all of our debating :).
