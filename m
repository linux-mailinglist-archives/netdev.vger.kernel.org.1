Patch with revert came month+ after we reported the issue and were ready
to do anything to find the root cause, so it is not the messaging issue,
it was the exclusion from process issue.

I tried to avoid to write the below, but because Jason brought it
already, I'll write my feelings.

Current netdev has very toxic environment, with binary separation to
vendors and not-vendors.

Vendors are bad guys who day and night try to cheat and sneak their
dirty hacks into the kernel. Their contributions are negligible and
can't be trusted by definition.

Luckily enough, there are some "not-vendors" and they are the good
guys who know what is the best for the community and all other world.

Thanks
