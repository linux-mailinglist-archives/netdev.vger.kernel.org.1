As far as the MAC/PCS code goes I will have to see what I can do. I
think I have to check with our sourcing team to figure out what
contracts are in place for whatever IP we are currently using before I
can share any additional info beyond the code here.

One other complication I can think of in terms of switching things
over as you have requested is that we will probably need to look at
splitting up the fbnic_mac.c file as it is currently used for both the
UEFI driver and the Linux driver so I will need to have a solution for
the UEFI driver which wouldn't have the advantage of phylink.

Thanks,
