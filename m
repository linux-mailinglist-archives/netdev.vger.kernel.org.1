The argument itself doesn't really hold water. The fact is the Meta
data centers are not an insignificant consumer of Linux, so it isn't
as if the driver isn't going to be used. This implies some lack of
good faith from Meta. I don't understand that as we are contributing
across multiple areas in the kernel including networking and ebpf. Is
Meta expected to start pulling time from our upstream maintainers to
have them update out-of-tree kernel modules since the community isn't
willing to let us maintain it in the kernel? Is the message that the
kernel is expected to get value from Meta, but that value is not meant
to be reciprocated? Would you really rather have us start maintaining
our own internal kernel with our own "proprietary goodness", and ask
other NIC vendors to have to maintain their drivers against yet
another kernel if they want to be used in our data centers?

As pointed out by Andew we aren't the first data center to push a
driver for our own proprietary device. The fact is there have been
drivers added for devices that were for purely emulated devices with
no actual customers such as rocker. Should the switch vendors at the
time have pushed back on it stating it wasn't a real "for sale"
device? The whole argument seems counter to what is expected. When a
vendor creates a new device and will likely be enabling new kernel
features my understanding is that it is better to be in the kernel
than not.

Putting a criteria on it that it must be "for sale" seems rather
arbitrary and capricious, especially given that most drivers have to
be pushed out long before they are available in the market in order to
meet deadlines to get the driver into OSV releases such as Redhat when
it hits the market. By that logic should we block all future drivers
until we can find them for sale somewhere? That way we don't run the
risk of adding a vendor driver for a product that might be scrapped
due to a last minute bug that will cause it to never be released.
