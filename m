Huh, interesting. I can see the practical sense in that, not causing
unnecessary churn and such.

At the same time, this doesn't appeal much to some sort of orderly part
of my mind. Either all kmalloc/kmem_cache memory is kfree()d as the rule
for what is best, or a kmalloc pairs with a kfree and a kmem_cache_alloc
pairs with a kmem_cache_free and that's the rule. And those can be
checked and enforced and so forth. But saying, "oh, well, they might
work a bit different, but whatever you want is basically fine; there's
no rhyme or reason" is somehow dissatisfying. Maybe the rule is
actually, "use kmem_cache_free if you can because it saves a pointer
lookup, but don't go out of your way to do that and certainly don't
bloat .text to make it happen," then maybe that makes sense? But I
dunno, I find myself wanting a rule and consistency. (Did you find it
annoying that in this paragraph, I used () on only one function mention
but not on the others? If so, maybe you're like me.) Maybe I should just
chill though. Anyway, only my 2Â¢, and my opinion here isn't worth much,
so please regard this as only a gut statement from a bystander.

Jason
