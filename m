I was suspecting bad HW, but some new platforms seems to be hitting it,
too. Which now makes me suspect PXE -> Linux hand off problem? 
Or multi-host?  Hard to tell..
Hopefully once it's not crashing it will be easier to do more analysis -
crashes within softirq during boot don't propagate too well into
monitoring systems :(

Thanks!
