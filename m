That doesn't actually exist, and your code snippet is also buggy (undefined
behavior) because it never sets the tfm pointer in the ahash_request.  So this
just shows that you still can't use your own proposed APIs correctly because
they're still too complex.  Yes the virt address support would be an improvement
on current ahash, but it would still be bolted onto an interface that wasn't
designed for it.  There would still be the weirdness of having to initialize so
many unnecessary fields in the request, and having "synchronous asynchronous
hashes" which is always a fun one to try to explain to people.  The shash and
lib/crypto/ interfaces are much better as they do not have these problems.

Well, the IAA and zswap people want a batch_compress method that takes an array
of pages
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20250206072102.29045-3-kanchana.p.sridhar@intel.com/).
They do not seem to want the weird request chaining thing that you are trying to
make them use.  batch_compress is actually quite similar to what I'm proposing,
just for compression instead of hashing.   So there is no conflict with my
proposal, and in fact they complement each other as they arrived at a similar
conclusion.  Hash and compression are different algorithm types, so they can
never use exactly the same API anyway, just similar ones.  And FWIW, zswap is
synchronous, so yet again all the weird async stuff just gets in the way.
