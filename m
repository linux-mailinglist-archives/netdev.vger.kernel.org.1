Agree, in ZC notification case, saving the notification for a future 
syscall is better than losing it forever. The difficulties I am aware of
are as follows,

If we find put_cmsg fails in
sendmsg_copy_cmsg_to_user, we have reached the end of ____sys_sendmsg,

1. Since the skb which carries the zc information has been freed from 
the errqueue. To roll back the effect, we need to sock_omalloc an skb
and insert it back. Or, we can store the information somewhere, but I
assume we need to allocate some memory, if the allocation fails, we may
still lose the info? Shall we make sure the allocation succeeds?

2. Currently, we free the skb in the hanlder of SCM_ZC_NOTIF, can we
free it after we are sure that put_cmsg succeed? One blocking I can
think of is that because of notification coalescing, the
information in the skb might be updated, since we snapshot the 
information earlier, so the information we copy to user might be
outdated. And, we also need a post handler for this cmsg_type, in
sendmsg_copy_cmsg_to_user.

3. The above is the specific unrolling/post handling logic for 
SCM_ZC_NOTIF. Each cmsg_type, which needs to be copied back could have
their own logic, we may add a function to handle it according to
cmsg_type. And call this function in sendmsg_copy_cmsg_to_user, to make
the code generic.

So besides ABI change, this is another problem we have for this
mechanism. These two concerns make our alternative usr_addr method(v4)
shine. In v4, users pass in a user address which points to a
zc_info_elem array. In the handler of SCM_ZC_NOTIF, we do copy to user
to that usr_addr. If it fails, in the context of the handler, the
unrolling is very clean and easy. The problem with this method is that
it makes the API of msg_control hacky.

Thanks for pointing this out, more comments are welcome!
