Thank you very much Dust Li for joining the discussion.

But you did not send that out, did you?
I hope I did not overlook an earlier proposal by you.


Here are some of my thoughts on the matter:

So where does the 'H' come from? If you want to call it Shared Memory _D_evice?


To my knowledge, a

Could you explain why that would be better?
'Internal Shared Memory' is supposed to be a bit of a counterpart to the
Remote 'R' in RoCE. Not the greatest name, but it is used already by our ISM
devices and by ism_loopback. So what is the benefit in changing it?

With this proposal ism_loopback is just another ism device and SMC-D will
handle removal just like ism_client.remove(ism_dev) of other ism devices.

But I understand that net/smc/ism_loopback.c today does not provide enable/disable,
which is a big disadvantage, I agree. The ism layer is prepared for dynamic
removal by ism_dev_unregister(). In case of this RFC that would only happen
in case of rmmod ism. Which should be improved.
One way to do that would be a separate ism_loopback kernel module, like you say.
Today ism_loopback is only 10k LOC, so I'd be fine with leaving it in the ism module.
I also think it is a great way for testing any ISM client, so it has benefit for
anybody using the ism module.
Another way would be e.g. an 'enable' entry in the sysfs of the loopback device.
(Once we agree if and how to represent ism devices in genera in sysfs).

The s390 ism_vpci devices are already backed by struct pci_dev. 
And I assume that would be represented in sysfs somehow like:
/sys/class/ism/ism_vp0/device -> /sys/devices/<pci bus no>/<pci dev no>
so there is an 
/sys/class/ism/<ism dev name>/device/enable entry already, 
because there is /sys/devices/<pci bus no>/<pci dev no>/enable today.

I remember Wen Gu's first proposal for ism_loopback had a device
in /sys/devices/virtual/ and had an 'active' entry to enable/disable.
Something like that could be linked to /sys/class/ism/ism_lo/device.
