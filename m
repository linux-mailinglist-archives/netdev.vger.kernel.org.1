Hi everyone,

Here is a V14 for the phy_port work, aiming at representing the
connectors and outputs of PHY devices.

Since V13, some kdoc warnings were fixed and the SFP code was rewritten
based on Russell's recent SFP module caps work.

This series is back to 16 patches, thanks to Russell's work on
simplifying SFP interface selection.

I know this is a lot to digest, but if any PHY maintainer would like to take
a look though I'd be very happy about that :)

As a remainder, a few important notes :

 - This is only a first phase. It instantiates the port, and leverage
   that to make the MAC <-> PHY <-> SFP usecase simpler.

 - Next phase will deal with controlling the port state, as well as the
   netlink uAPI for that.

 - The end-goal is to enable support for complex port MUX. This
   preliminary work focuses on PHY-driven ports, but this will be
   extended to support muxing at the MII level (Multi-phy, or compo PHY
   + SFP as found on Turris Omnia for example).

 - The naming is definitely not set in stone. I named that "phy_port",
   but this may convey the false sense that this is phylib-specific.
   Even the word "port" is not that great, as it already has several
   different meanings in the net world (switch port, devlink port,
   etc.). I used the term "connector" in the binding.

A bit of history on that work :

The end goal that I personnaly want to achieve is :

            + PHY - RJ45
            | 
 MAC - MUX -+ PHY - RJ45

After many discussions here on netdev@, but also at netdevconf[1] and
LPC[2], there appears to be several analoguous designs that exist out
there.

[1] : https://netdevconf.info/0x17/sessions/talk/improving-multi-phy-and-multi-port-interfaces.html
[2] : https://lpc.events/event/18/contributions/1964/ (video isn't the
right one)

Take the MAchiatobin, it has 2 interfaces that looks like this :

 MAC - PHY -+ RJ45
            |
	    + SFP - Whatever the module does

Now, looking at the Turris Omnia, we have :


 MAC - MUX -+ PHY - RJ45
            |
	    + SFP - Whatever the module does

We can find more example of this kind of designs, the common part is
that we expose multiple front-facing media ports. This is what this
current work aims at supporting. As of right now, it does'nt add any
support for muxing, but this will come later on.

This first phase focuses on phy-driven ports only, but there are already
quite some challenges already. For one, we can't really autodetect how
many ports are sitting behind a PHY. That's why this series introduces a
new binding. Describing ports in DT should however be a last-resort
thing when we need to clear some ambiguity about the PHY media-side.

The only use-cases that we have today for multi-port PHYs are combo PHYs
that drive both a Copper port and an SFP (the Macchiatobin case). This
in itself is challenging and this series only addresses part of this
support, by registering a phy_port for the PHY <-> SFP connection. The
SFP module should in the end be considered as a port as well, but that's
not yet the case.

However, because now PHYs can register phy_ports for every media-side
interface they have, they can register the capabilities of their ports,
which allows making the PHY-driver SFP case much more generic.

Let me know what you think, I'm all in for discussions :)

Regards,

Changes in V14:
 - Fixed kdoc
 - Use the sfp module_caps feature.

Changes in V13:
 - Added phy_caps support for interface selection
 - Aggregated tested-by tags

Changes in V12:
 - Moved some of phylink's internal helpers to phy_caps for reuse in
   phylib
 - Fixed SFP interface selection
 - Added Rob's review and changes in patch 6

Changes in V11:
 - The ti,fiber-mode property was deprecated in favor of the
   ethernet-connector binding
 - The .attach_port was split into an MDI and an MII version
 - I added the warning back in the AR8031 PHY driver
 - There is now an init-time check on the number of lanes associated to
   every linkmode, making sure the number of lanes is above or equal to
   the minimum required
 - Various typos were fixed all around
 - We no longer use sfp_select_interface() for SFP interface validation

Changes in V10:
 - Rebase on net-next
 - Fix a typo reported by KÃ¶ry
 - Aggregate all reviews
 - Fix the conflict on the qcom driver

Changes in V9:
 - Removed maxItems and items from the connector binding
 - Fixed a typo in the binding

Changes in V8:
 - Added maxItems on the connector media binding
 - Made sure we parse a single medium
 - Added a missing bitwise macro

Changes in V7:
 - Move ethtool_medium_get_supported to phy_caps
 - support combo-ports, each with a given set of supported modes
 - Introduce the notion of 'not-described' ports

Changes in V6:

 - Fixed kdoc on patch 3
 - Addressed a missing port-ops registration for the Marvell 88x2222
   driver
 - Addressed a warning reported by Simon on the DP83822 when building
   without CONFIG_OF_MDIO

Changes in V5 :

 - renamed the bindings to use the term "connector" instead of "port"
 - Rebased, and fixed some issues reported on the 83822 driver
 - Use phy_caps

Changes in V4 :

 - Introduced a kernel doc
 - Reworked the mediums definitions in patch 2
 - QCA807x now uses the generic SFP support
 - Fixed some implementation bugs to build the support list based on the
   interfaces supported on a port
