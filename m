Sorry for the late reply,
I found out that security_sock_rcv_skb() can also be called without
locking the IPv6 socket (this can be easily verified by manual testing).

Netfilter hooks seems to be ok, family value is taken from the
nf_hook_state structure, so there is no access to sk->sk_family.

SCTP and MPTCP hooks should not be considered, because IPV6_ADDRFORM is
only available for TCP, UDP and UDPLITE protocols.

There are 2 more functions that access sk_family:
* security_sock_graft() - socket is locked by inet_accept(),
* security_inet_conn_established() - socket is locked by connect(2) or
   in BH context (Cf. tcp_v6_rcv).

Indeed, using READ_ONCE() in the considered hooks should not lead to
any overhead. I wonder if it would be better not to touch the SCTP
and MPTCP hooks anyway. Adding READ_ONCE() in selinux_sock_graft() is
fine if you think it's better this way.
