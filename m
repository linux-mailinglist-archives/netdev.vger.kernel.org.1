If _gate is not defined, these appear to be mux clocks rather than 
mux-gates. In that case, they should be defined accordingly - I believe 
MUX_CLR_SET_UPD would be appropriate here?

I think that actually makes sense - before the patch, the fields from 
struct mtk_gate were copied into mtk_clk_gate, so it didnâ€™t matter if 
the original data was freed. After the refactoring we store a pointer, 
so once those sections are released, any runtime clock enable ends up 
using a dangling pointer.

As those clocks seems to be used during runtime, removing __initconst
seems like the right thing to do. Those mux-gates that lack a gate 
should be turned into plain muxes anyway though.

Best,

Laura

>>>>> MT8196 uses a HW voter for gate enable/disable control, with
>>>>> set/clr/sta registers located in a separate regmap. Refactor
>>>>> mtk_clk_register_gate() to take a struct mtk_gate, and add a pointer to
>>>>> it in struct mtk_clk_gate. This allows reuse of the static gate data
>>>>> (including HW voter register offsets) without adding extra function
>>>>> arguments, and removes redundant duplication in the runtime data struct.
