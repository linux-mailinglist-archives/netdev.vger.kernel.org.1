hi,

thank you for spending time on this problem.

we followed your suggestion to try the actual kernel (we've tried it
before without success), but now with clean build from scratch instead
of using the old tree with incremental patches and voila: we can't
reproduce the behaviour any more!

sorry for that. if there will be ever again such a problem, we will
first try to make a clean build before asking for help.

best regards

x.
