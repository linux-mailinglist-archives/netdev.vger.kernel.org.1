Please, let us keep the avoiding duplication as a separate topic atleast for
the discussion. We can take care of it even before merging if you prefer that
way but we need to explore what other drivers can use it. Otherwise it is
not yet duplication right ?

Sure, if there is only and first driver needing large buffers, it is still
not duplication yet. I agree it can be moved to PCC, but lets start with
you client driver code first and then take it from there.

No, it is left to the client driver interpretation as it clearly varies even
within PCC type 1-5. Again, let us start with client driver code and see how
to standardise later. I agree with PCC being standard, there is scope for
avoiding duplication, but we will get to know that only if you first present
it with the client driver code and we can then see how and what to make
generic.

Don't even go there. It is much bigger beast with all sorts of things to
consider. Now that you have mentioned that, I am interested more to look
at MPAM driver usage as well before merging anything as generic as I know
MPAM is not so trivial. You pulled that topic into this, sorry ðŸ˜‰.

Sorry if I am slow in understanding but I still struggle why tx_prepare won't
work for you. Please don't jump to solve 2 problems at the same time as it
just adds more confusion. Let us see if and how to make tx_prepare work for
your driver. And then we can look at standardising it as a helper function
that can be use in all the PCC mailbox client drivers if we can do that.

You are just adding parallel and optional APIs just to get your driver
working here. I am not against standardising to avoid duplication which
is your concern(very valid) but doen't need to be solved by adding another
API when the existing APIs already provides mechanism to do that.

If you need information about the PCC type3/4, we can explore that as well.

OK, but I would like to start fresh reverting this patch.

Not always necessary. Yes if it is agreed to get the user merged. But I am
now questioning why you need it when you do have rx_callback.

Sorry if I have missed it. Can you please point me to the race condition in
question. I am interested to know more details.

I assume it can't be beyond the shmem area anyways. That can be read from the
rx_callback. Again I haven't understood your reasoning as why the allocation
and copy can't be part of rx_callback.

True but you have changed the generic code which could break Type1/2 PCC.
I am not sure if it is tested yet.

No you need to take care to apply your changes only for Type3/4 so that
Type1/2 is unaffected. You can expect to break and someone else to fix
the breakage later.

Agreed, that's not the argument. The check is done unconditionally. I will
send the patch once we agree to revert this change and start fresh. And each
feature handled separately instead of mixing 3 different things in one patch.

Sure. Lets revert this patch and start discussing your individual requirements
in individual patches and check why tx_prepare and rx_callback can't work for
you. Please share the client driver code changes you tried when checking
tx_prepare and rx_callback as well so that we can see why it can't work.
