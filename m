I can remove it.  But it leads to issues, for example one flowtable
can shadow another one.

I'd prefer to handle this from control plane and reject such config.
Alternative is to ignore this and handle it as "self sabotage, don't
care" combined with "do not do that, then".

Won't that complicate things?  Userspace will have to use netlink
events to discover when a flowtable is removed, no?
