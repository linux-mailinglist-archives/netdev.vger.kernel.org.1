v9:
We have not provided a detailed list of equipment for a long time,
and I apologize for this. During this period, I have collected some
information and now present it to you, hoping to alleviate the pressure
of review.

1. IP core
We now have two types of IP cores, one is 0x37, similar to dwmac1000;
The other is 0x10.  Compared to 0x37, we split several DMA registers
from one to two, and it is not worth adding a new entry for this.
According to Serge's comment, we made these devices work by overwriting
priv->synopsys_id = 0x37 and mac->dma = <LS_dma_ops>.

1.1.  Some more detailed information
The number of DMA channels for 0x37 is 1; The number of DMA channels
for 0x10 is 8.  Except for channel 0, otherchannels do not support
sending hardware checksums. Supported AV features are Qav, Qat, and Qas,
and the rest are consistent with 3.73.

2. DEVICE
We have two types of devices,
one is GMAC, which only has a MAC chip inside and needs an external PHY
chip;
the other is GNET, which integrates both MAC and PHY chips inside.

2.1.  Some more detailed information
GMAC device: LS7A1000, LS2K1000, these devices do not support any pause
mode.
gnet device: LS7A2000, LS2K2000, the chip connection between the mac and
             phy of these devices is not normal and requires two rounds of
             negotiation; LS7A2000 does not support half-duplex and
multi-channel;
             to enable multi-channel on LS2K2000, you need to turn off
hardware checksum.
**Note**: Only the LS2K2000's IP core is 0x10, while the IP cores of other
devices are 0x37.

3. TABLE

device    type    pci_id    ip_core
ls7a1000  gmac    7a03      0x37
ls2k1000  gmac    7a03      0x37
ls7a2000  gnet    7a13      0x37
ls2k2000  gnet    7a13      0x10
-----------------------------------------------
Changes:

* passed the CI
  <https://github.com/linux-netdev/nipa/blob/main/tests/patch/checkpatch
  /checkpatch.sh>
* reverse xmas tree order.
* Silence build warning.
* Re-split the patch.
* Add more detailed commit message.
* Add more code comment.
* Reduce modification of generic code.
* using the GNET-specific prefix.
* define a new macro for the GNET MAC.
* Use an easier way to overwrite mac.
* Removed some useless printk.


v8:
* The biggest change is according to Serge's comment in the previous
  edition:
   Seeing the patch in the current state would overcomplicate the generic
   code and the only functions you need to update are
   dwmac_dma_interrupt()
   dwmac1000_dma_init_channel()
   you can have these methods re-defined with all the Loongson GNET
   specifics in the low-level platform driver (dwmac-loongson.c). After
   that you can just override the mac_device_info.dma pointer with a
   fixed stmmac_dma_ops descriptor. Here is what should be done for that:

   1. Keep the Patch 4/9 with my comments fixed. First it will be partly
   useful for your GNET device. Second in general it's a correct
   implementation of the normal DW GMAC v3.x multi-channels feature and
   will be useful for the DW GMACs with that feature enabled.

   2. Create the Loongson GNET-specific
   stmmac_dma_ops.dma_interrupt()
   stmmac_dma_ops.init_chan()
   methods in the dwmac-loongson.c driver. Don't forget to move all the
   Loongson-specific macros from dwmac_dma.h to dwmac-loongson.c.

   3. Create a Loongson GNET-specific platform setup method with the next
   semantics:
      + allocate stmmac_dma_ops instance and initialize it with
        dwmac1000_dma_ops.
      + override the stmmac_dma_ops.{dma_interrupt, init_chan} with
        the pointers to the methods defined in 2.
      + allocate mac_device_info instance and initialize the
        mac_device_info.dma field with a pointer to the new
        stmmac_dma_ops instance.
      + call dwmac1000_setup() or initialize mac_device_info in a way
        it's done in dwmac1000_setup() (the later might be better so you
        wouldn't need to export the dwmac1000_setup() function).
      + override stmmac_priv.synopsys_id with a correct value.

   4. Initialize plat_stmmacenet_data.setup() with the pointer to the
   method created in 3.

* Others:
  Re-split the patch.
  Passed checkpatch.pl test.

v7:
* Refer to andrew's suggestion:
  - Add DMA_INTR_ENA_NIE_RX and DMA_INTR_ENA_NIE_TX #define's, etc.

* Others:
  - Using --subject-prefix="PATCH net-next vN" to indicate that the
    patches are for the networking tree.
  - Rebase to the latest networking tree:
    <git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netdev/net-next.git>


v6:

* Refer to Serge's suggestion:
  - Add new platform feature flag:
    include/linux/stmmac.h:
    +#define STMMAC_FLAG_HAS_LGMAC			BIT(13)

  - Add the IRQs macros specific to the Loongson Multi-channels GMAC:
     drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/dwmac_dma.h:
     +#define DMA_INTR_ENA_NIE_LOONGSON 0x00060000      /* ...*/
     #define DMA_INTR_ENA_NIE 0x00010000	/* Normal Summary */
     ...

  - Drop all of redundant changes that don't require the
    prototypes being converted to accepting the stmmac_priv
    pointer.

* Refer to andrew's suggestion:
  - Drop white space changes.
  - break patch up into lots of smaller parts.
     Some small patches have been put into another series as a preparation
     see <https://lore.kernel.org/loongarch/cover.1702289232.git.siyanteng@loongson.cn/T/#t>
     
     *note* : This series of patches relies on the three small patches above.
* others
  - Drop irq_flags changes.
  - Changed patch order.


v4 -> v5:

* Remove an ugly and useless patch (fix channel number).
* Remove the non-standard dma64 driver code, and also remove
  the HWIF entries, since the associated custom callbacks no
  longer exist.
* Refer to Serge's suggestion: Update the dwmac1000_dma.c to
  support the multi-DMA-channels controller setup.
