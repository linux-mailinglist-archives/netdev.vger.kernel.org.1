O.K. Same thing, different scale.

But for 2x50CR2 you have two MACs? And for 4x25CR 4 MACs?

Or is there always 4 MACs, each MAC has its own queues, and you need
to place frames into the correct queue, and with a 2x50CR2 you also
need to load balance across those two queues?

I guess the queuing does not matter much to phylink, but how do you
represent multiple PCS lanes to phylink? Up until now, one netdev has
had one PCS lane. It now has 1, 2, or 4 lanes. None of the
phylink_pcs_op have a lane indicator.

That might work for direct-attach, but what about the general case? We
need to ensure whatever we add supports the general case.

The current SFP code expects a Linux I2C bus. Given how SFPs are
broken, it does 16 bytes reads at the most. When it needs to read more
than 16 bytes, i expect it will set the page once, read it back to
ensure the SFP actually implements the page, and then do multiple I2C
reads to read all the data it wants from that page. I don't see how
this is going to work when the I2C bus is shared.

Yours might be, but what is the general case?
