Agree, "realtek,smi-mdio" is not a great compatible string. But it is an
established compatible string.

The naming choice really looks like the secondary problem here.
But what about "realtek,rtl8365mb-mdio" and "realtek,rtl8366rb-mdio" as
a secondary compatible string for SMI, and primary compatible string for
MDIO-connected switches?

You could do that. There's a very high chance that the node was named
"mdio". The schema says it should be called "mdio", _and_ be compatible
with realtek,smi-mdio. If anyone comes and complains (very unlikely),
just say "hey, even Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/dsa/realtek-smi.txt
said you should name the node 'mdio'"!

Not everything that is in the device tree has to be used. It is a
description of the hardware, not a rigid set of instructions for what
the OS has to do. The OS still does whatever it wants based on that info.

You can ask anyone about this. See Thomas Petazzoni's slides as just one
example.
https://elinux.org/images/f/f9/Petazzoni-device-tree-dummies_0.pdf

| The Device Tree is really a hardware description language.
| It should describe the hardware layout, and how it works.
| But it should not describe which particular hardware configuration youâ€™re interested in.
| As an example:
| You may describe in the DT whether a particular piece of hardware supports DMA or not.

It's a really weak argument for recommending users to remove the compatible
string, thereby deliberately breaking ABI compatibility in one direction,
to literally _no_ benefit.

Compatible strings for MDIO controllers are, in essence, not strange.
They are independent devices which could reasonably be bound to their
own drivers. I don't see what's awkward about this.
