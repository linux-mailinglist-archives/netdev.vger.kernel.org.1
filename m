Why not? Just because we are not commercially selling it doesn't mean
we couldn't look at other solutions such as QEMU. If we were to
provide a github repo with an emulation of the NIC would that be
enough to satisfy the "commercial" requirement?

The fact is I already have an implementation, but I would probably
need to clean up a few things as the current setup requires 3 QEMU
instances to emulate the full setup with host, firmware, and BMC. It
wouldn't be as performant as the actual hardware but it is more than
enough for us to test code with. If we need to look at publishing
something like that to github in order to address the lack of user
availability I could start looking at getting the approvals for that.

That is a faulty argument. That is like saying we should kick out the
nouveu driver out of Linux just because it supports Nvidia graphics
cards that happen to also have a proprietary out-of-tree driver out
there, or maybe we need to kick all the Intel NIC drivers out for
DPDK? I can't think of many NIC vendors that don't have their own
out-of-tree drivers floating around with their own kernel bypass
solutions to support proprietary software.

I agree. We need a consistent set of standards. I just strongly
believe commercial availability shouldn't be one of them.
