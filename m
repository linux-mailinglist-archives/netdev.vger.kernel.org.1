I agree; this can be added later. For now, we can simply support
unregistering a device from the device driver. Which is already handled
by ism_dev_unregister() IIUC.

However, I believe we still need an API and the ability to enable or
disable ISM devices from the upper layer. For example, if we want to
disable a specific ISM device (such as the loopback device) in SMC, we
should not do so by disabling the loopback device at the device layer,
as it may also serve other clients beyond SMC.

Further more, I think removing the loopback from the loopback device
driver seems unnecessory ? Since we should support that from the upper
layer in the future.

Best regards,
Dust
