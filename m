This is a slippery-slope fallacy and doesn't apply. Yes, we don't add vast
amounts of code for that and that isn't the case here. This is fixing a
known weakness of using atomic reference counts, with a long history of
exploitation, on a struct used for enforcing security boundaries, solved
with the kernel's standard reference counting type. As I mentioned in
the other arm[1] of this thread, I think the question is better "Why is
this NOT refcount_t? What is the benefit, and why does that make struct
cred special?"

The only overhead is on slow-path for the error conditions. There is no
_known_ bug in the cred code today, but there might be unknown flaws,
or new flaws or unexpected reachability may be introduced in the future.
That's the whole point of making kernel code defensive. I've talked about
this (with lots of data to support it) at length before[2], mainly around
the lifetime of exploitable flaws: average lifetime is more than 5 years
and we keep introducing them in code that uses fragile types or ambiguous
language features. But I _haven't_ had to talk much about reference
counting since 2016 when we grew a proper type for it. :)

Let's get the stragglers fixed.
