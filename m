Let me provide the context of what has been discussed. Essentially, the
question is what the proper name of the netlink protocol is and its file
name for the energy model.

Donald raised concerns that “em” is too cryptic, so it should be
“energy-model”. The following is Donald’s comment:


   “- I think the spec could have been called energy-model.yaml and the
    family called "energy-model" instead of "em".”


Andrew’s opinion is that it would be appropriate to limit the scope of
“energy-model” by adding a prefix, for example, “performance-domain-
energy-model”. Andrew’s comment is as follows:

   “And a dumb question. What is an energy model? A PSE needs some level
   of energy model, it needs to know how much energy each PD can consume
   in order that it is not oversubscribed. Is the energy model generic
   enough that it could be used for this? Or should this energy model get
   a prefix to limit its scope to a performance domain? The suggested
   name of this file would then become something like
   performance-domain-energy-model.yml?”

For me, “performance-domain-energy-model” sounds weird because the
performance domain is conceptually under the energy model. If adding a
prefix to limit the scope, it should be something like “system-energy-
model”, and the “system” prefix looks redundant to me.

So, the question is what the proper name is for the energy model
protocol: “em”, “energy-model”, “performance-domain-energy-model”, or
something else?
