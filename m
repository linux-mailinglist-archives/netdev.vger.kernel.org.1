How many cases of that have we had in the past? I'm honestly curious
as I don't actually have any reference.

Also as far as item 3 isn't hard for it to be a "user-visible"
regression if there are no users outside of the vendor that is
maintaining the driver to report it? Again I am assuming that the same
rules wouldn't necessarily apply in the vendor/consumer being one
entity case.

Also from my past experience the community doesn't give a damn about
1. It is only if 3 is being reported by actual users that somebody
would care. The fact is if vendors held that much power they would
have run roughshod over the community long ago as I know there are
vendors who love to provide one-off projects outside of the kernel and
usually have to work to get things into the upstream later and no
amount of complaining about "the users" will get their code accepted.
The users may complain but it is the vendors fault for that so the
community doesn't have to take action.
