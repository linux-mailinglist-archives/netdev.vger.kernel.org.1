Thanks for the offer of testing.

Do you know how the stmmac core has been synthesized as far as the
MII interface from it?

If not, if it's using gmac1000, possibly later cores as well, then
DMA_HW_FEATURE (or FEATURE0) bits 30:28 should give that information.
I'd guess GMII, so probably contains 0. The driver doesn't actually
use these, or even look at them.
