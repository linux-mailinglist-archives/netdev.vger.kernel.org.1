Used by one user. Consider a person creating some custom proprietary
FPGA based pet project for himself, trying to add driver for it to the
mainline kernel. Why? Nobody else will ever see the device, why the
community should be involved at all? Does not make sense. Have the
driver for your internal cook-ups internal.

If Meta contributes whatever may be useful for somebody else, it is
completely fine. This driver is not useful for anyone, except Meta.

I don't care, maintain whatever you want internally. Totally up to you.
Just try to understand my POV. I may believe you have good faith and
everything. But still, I think that community has to be selfish.

If you proprietary device is used by other people running virtual
machines on your systems, that is completely fine. But that is incorrect
analogy to your nic, no outside-Meta person will ever see it!


>drivers added for devices that were for purely emulated devices with

This is completely fault analogy. Rocker was introduced to solve
chicken-egg problem to ass switch device support into kernel. It served
the purpose quite well. Let it rot now.

Not "for sale", but "available to the outside person".

Not capricious at all, I sorry you feel that way. You proceed your
company goals, my position here is to defend the community and
the unnecessary and pointless burden you are putting on it.

That is or course obviously complete fault analogy again. You never plan
to introduce your device to public. Big difference. Don't you see it?
