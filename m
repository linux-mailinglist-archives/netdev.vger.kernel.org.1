And this is the problem, you don't have "any reference" and accurate
knowledge what happened, but you are saying "less than cooperative
maintainer".

This wasn't the case. It was change in core code, which broke specific
version of vagrant. Vendor caught it simply by luck.

You are taking it to completely wrong direction with your assumptions.
The reality is that regression was reported by real user without any
vendor code involved. This is why the end result was so bad for all parties.

So no, you can get "less than cooperative maintainer" label really easy in
current environment.
