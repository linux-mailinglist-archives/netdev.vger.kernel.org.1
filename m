This "custom driver" is needed for CPC too, right?
You need some way to translate what's happening in
the kernel into directions sent over your transport
to the hardware on the other side.

Don't worry about proposing changes to Greybus.  But
please do it incrementally, and share what you would
like to do, so people can help steer you in the most
promising direction.
