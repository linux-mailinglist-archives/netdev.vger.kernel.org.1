I'm not sure what you intended with the second line, which looks like it won't
compile.  The first line also shows that ahash_request has a large alignment for
DMA, which is irrelevant for CPU based crypto.  And I'm not sure
__attribute__((aligned)) with that alignment on the stack even works reliably
all architectures; we've had issues with that in the past.  So again you're
still proposing APIs with weird quirks caused by bolting CPU-based crypto
support onto an API designed for an obsolete style of hardware offload.

Here's the compression in zswap:

    comp_ret = crypto_wait_req(crypto_acomp_compress(acomp_ctx->req), &acomp_ctx->wait);

And here's the decompression:

    BUG_ON(crypto_wait_req(crypto_acomp_decompress(acomp_ctx->req), &acomp_ctx->wait));

It waits synchronously for each request to complete.

It doesn't want an asynchronous API.

The IAA driver doesn't actually support encryption, so that's a very bad start.
But even assuming it was added, the premise of IAA being helpful for IPsec seems
questionable.  AES-GCM is already accelerated via the VAES and VPCLMULQDQ
instructions, performing at 10-30 GB/s per thread on recent processors.  It's
hard to see how legacy-style offload can beat that in practice, when accounting
for all the driver overhead and the fact that memory often ends up as the
bottleneck these days.  But of course for optimal IPsec performance you actually
need adapter-level offload (inline crypto) which does not use the crypto API at
all, so again the legacy-style offload support in the crypto API is irrelevant.

But, this is tangential to this discussion, since we can still keep the legacy
style hardware offload APIs around for the few users that think they want them.
The point is that we shouldn't let them drag down everyone else.
