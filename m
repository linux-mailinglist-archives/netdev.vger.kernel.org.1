Yes, I just made a bit change in the userspace libquic:

  https://github.com/lxin/quic/commit/9c75bd42769a8cbc1652e2f4c8d77780f23af=
de6

So you can set up multple ALPNs on listen sock:

  setsockopt(listenfd, QUIC_SOCKOPT_ALPN, "smbd, h3, ksmbd");

Then during handshake, the matched ALPN from client will be set into
the accept socket, then users can get it later after handshake.

Note that userspace libquic is a very light lib (a couple of hundred lines
of code), you can add more TLS related support without touching Kernel code=
,
including the SNI support you mentioned.

It doesn't sound common to me, but yes, I think Unix Domain Sockets
can pass it to another process.

Correct, in-kernel QUIC should only do the QUIC related things,
and all TLS handshake msgs must be handled in Userspace.
This won't cause "layering violation", as Nick Banks said.

For initlal decryption, the keys can be derived with the initial packet.
basically, it only needs the dst_connection_id from the client initial
packet. see:

  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9001#name-initial-secrets

so we don't need to set up anything to kernel for initial's keys.

But for the handshake, application or early_data keys, they will be set
up into kernel during handshake via:

  setsockopt(QUIC_SOCKOPT_CRYPTO_SECRET)
