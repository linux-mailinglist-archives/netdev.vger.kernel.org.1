One wider conceptual comment.

Starting with v6.15 it is possible to retrieve exit information from
pidfds even after the task has been reaped. So if someone opens a pidfd
via pidfd_open() and that task gets reaped by the parent it is possible
to call PIDFD_INFO_EXIT and you can retrieve the exit status and the
cgroupid of the task that was reaped. That works even after all task
linkage has been removed from struct pid.

The system call api doesn't allow the creation of pidfds for reaped
processes. It wouldn't be possible as the pid number will have already
been released.

Both SO_PEERPIDFD and SO_PASSPIDFD also don't allow the creation of
pidfds for already reaped peers or senders.

But that doesn't have to be the case since we always have the struct pid
available. So it's entirely possible to hand out a pidfd to a reaped
process if it's guaranteed that exit information is available. If it's
not then this would be a bug.

The trick is that when a struct pid is stashed it needs to also allocate
a pidfd inode. That could simply be done by a helper get_pidfs_pid()
which takes a reference to the struct pid and ensures that space for
recording exit information is available.

With that done SO_PEERCGROUPID isn't needed per se as it will be
possible to get the cgroupid and exit status from the pidfd.

From a cursory look that should be possible to do without too much work.
I'm just pointing this out as an alternative.

There's one restriction that this would be subject to that
SO_PEERCGROUPID isn't. The SO_PEERCGROUPID is exposed for any process
whereas PIDFD_GET_INFO ioctls (that includes the PIDFD_INFO_EXIT) option
is only available for processes within the receivers pid namespace
hierarchy.

But in any case, enabling pidfds for such reaped processes might still
be useful since it would mean receivers could get exit information for
pidfds within their pid namespace hierarchy.
