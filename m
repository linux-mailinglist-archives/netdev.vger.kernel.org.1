Does any of this include mvneta?

static int mvneta_ethtool_get_eee(struct net_device *dev,
                                  struct ethtool_keee *eee)
{
        struct mvneta_port *pp = netdev_priv(dev);
        u32 lpi_ctl0;

        lpi_ctl0 = mvreg_read(pp, MVNETA_LPI_CTRL_0);

        eee->eee_enabled = pp->eee_enabled;
        eee->eee_active = pp->eee_active;
        eee->tx_lpi_enabled = pp->tx_lpi_enabled;
        eee->tx_lpi_timer = (lpi_ctl0) >> 8; // * scale;

        return phylink_ethtool_get_eee(pp->phylink, eee);
}

Any driver that writes any members of struct ethtool_keee before
calling phylink_ethtool_get_eee() or phy_ethtool_get_eee() was
broken by the merging of phylib-managed EEE. I've been submitting
patches to fix these over time, such as my recently merged DSA
patches that remove the now useless get_mac_eee() method.

The biggest problem is that phylib overwrites eee->tx_lpi_timer,
which broke a lot of drivers. For example, I've fixed FEC:

3fa2540d93d8 net: fec: use phydev->eee_cfg.tx_lpi_timer

Anyway, I'm going to re-post a cut-down version of my phylink-
managed EEE support once Herner's EEE patch set has been merged.
This will convert mvneta, lan743x and stmmac, and add support for
mvpp2, thus resolving the breakage in at last some of those drivers..
