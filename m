I would also disagree with the attached patches for various reasons:
- The QFQ patch relies on packet size backlog, which is not to be
  trusted because of several sources that may make this unreliable
  (netem, size tables, GSO, etc.)
- In the TBF variant the ret may get overwritten during the loop,
  so it only relies on the final packet status. I would not trust
  this always working either.
- DRR fix seems fine, but it still requires all other qdiscs to 
  be correct (and something similar needs to be applied to all
  classfull qdiscs?)
- The changes to qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog do not really make sense
  to me I must be missing something here..

What do you think the root cause is here? AFAIK what all the issues 
have in common is that eventually qlen_notify is _not_ called, 
thus leaving stale class pointers. Naturally the consequence 
could be to simply always call qlen_notify on class deletion and 
make classfull qdiscs aware that it may get called on inactive 
classes. And this is what I tried with my proposal.
This does not solve the backlog issues though. But the pressing 
issue seems to be the uaf and not the statistic counters?

My concern with preventing certain hierarchies is that we would 
hide the backlog issues and we would be chasing bad hierarchies.
Still it would also solve all the problems eventually I guess.

Thanks,
Lion
