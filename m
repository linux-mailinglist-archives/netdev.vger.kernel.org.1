The gain is the same as if company X makes a card and sells it
exclusively to datacenter provider Y. We know this happens.
Vendors would happily spin up a NIC if a DC with scale like this
would pay for it. They just don't advertise it in patch 0/X,
"adding device for cloud provider foo".

There is no difference here. We gain developers, we gain insights,
learnings and Linux and OSS drivers are running on another big
DC. They improve things and find bugs they upstream them its a win.

The opposite is also true if we exclude a driver/NIC HW that is
running on major DCs we lose a lot of insight, experience, value.
DCs are all starting to build their own hardware if we lose this
section of HW we lose those developers too. We are less likely
to get any advances they come up with. I think you have it backwards.
Eventually Linux networking becomes either commodity and irrelevant
for DC deployments.

So I strongly disagree we lose by excluding drivers and win by
bringing it in.
