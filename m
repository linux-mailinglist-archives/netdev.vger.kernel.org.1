Yes, these two clocks are used by MAC and PCS to clock data to one
another. The MAC Rx/Tx clocks and MII Rx/Tx clocks are different clocks
and can be enabled/disabled independently. However their parent clock is
the same and hence their rate is same at all times. For example, the
phylink ops will set the rate of MAC Rx/Tx during a link speed change,
and this same rate is effected for the MII Rx/Tx clock.

Sure for the purpose of rest of this discussion, we can refer to them as
MII Rx/Tx clocks.

I would also like to clarify that each of the '(X)PCS' blocks shown in
the diagram, includes two PCS types, a 'PCS' type that supports 1Gbps
PCS modes, and another 'XPCS' block (Synopsys) that supports 10Gbps PCS
modes. The MII Rx/Tx clocks from the NSS CC, are supplied to the xGMII
channels of both these PCS.

Yes, this is correct.

The SERDES in the UNIPHY does not consume the MII Rx/Tx clocks. The
consumer of these clocks is the PCS block within the UNIPHY.

The SERDES only provides the source Rx/tx clocks to the NSS CC, and the
NSS CC divides this clock and supplies the per-channel MII Rx/Tx clocks
to the PCS.

The Rx/Tx clocks sourced from the SERDES are registered as provider
clocks by the UNIPHY/PCS driver during probe time. There is no runtime
operation needed for these clocks after this.

The MII Rx/Tx clocks are enabled later when the MAC is initialized by
the network driver. The network driver calls an API exported by the PCS
driver, which creates the PCS instance and enables the MII Rx/Tx clocks.
Ideally, the PCS driver probe should have completed and provider clocks
registered, by the time the MAC is initialized (we handle the error case
in case the probe is still not complete).
