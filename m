Yes, unfortunately these devices have same IDs as "regular" NICs and the
difference in some FW configuration.

We always read VPD by using "sudo ..." command, until one of our customers
requested to provide a way to run monitoring library without any root access.
It runs on hypervisor and being non-root there is super important for them.

This patch allows non-root read for Mellanox (NICs) devices only and
such access is going to be used only once during library initiation
flow. So nothing from above is applicable in our case.

In general case, all devices in the world were accessed at least once
with "sudo lspci ....", during their bringup, installation, daily use
e.t.c. Broken devices are filtered by kernel and have limited access
to VPD.

So if it is broken, it will be broken with sudo too.

It is not different from any other feature. MLNX devices exist for more
than 25 years already and we never exposed anything sensitive through VPD.

I'm confident that we have no plans to change this policy in the future
either.

It is kernel controlled exposure, through well defined sysfs file and
in-kernel API for very specific PCI section. Device BAR is much more
than that.
