Hello,

Now that we can discover our peer coordinators or make ourselves
dynamically discoverable, we may use the information about surrounding
devices to create PANs dynamically. This involves of course:
* Requesting an association to a coordinator, waiting for the response
* Sending a disassociation notification to a coordinator
* Receiving an association request when we are coordinator, answering
  the request (for now all devices are accepted up to a limit, to be
  refined)
* Sending a disassociation notification to a child
* Users may request the list of associated devices (the parent and the
  children).

Here are a few example of userspace calls that can be made:
iwpan dev <dev> associate pan_id 2 coord $COORD
iwpan dev <dev> list_associations
iwpan dev <dev> disassociate ext_addr $COORD

I used a small using hwsim to scan for a coordinator, associate with
it, look at the associations on both sides, disassociate from it and
check the associations again:
./assoc-demo
*** Scan ***
PAN 0x0002 (on wpan1)
	coordinator 0x060f3b35169a498f
	page 0
	channel 13
	preamble code 0
	mean prf 0
	superframe spec. 0xcf11
	LQI ff
*** End of scan ***
Associating wpan1 with coord0 0x060f3b35169a498f...
Dumping coord0 assoc:
child : 0x0b6f / 0xba7633ae47ccfb21
Dumping wpan1 assoc:
parent: 0xffff / 0x060f3b35169a498f
Disassociating from wpan1
Dumping coord0 assoc:
Dumping wpan1 assoc:

I could also successfully interact with a smaller device running Zephir,
using its command line interface to associate and then disassociate from
the Linux coordinator.

Thanks!
MiquÃ¨l

Changes in v5:
* Fixed (again) the helper supposed to check whether a device requesting
  association/disassociation is already (or not) in our PAN. We don't
  nee to check short addresses there.
* Changed the name of the helper a second time to make it more relevant
  and understandable:
  cfg802154_device_in_pan() -> cfg802154_pan_device_is_matching()
* Fixed a kernel test robot report where we would use an int instead of
  a __le16. Solved that by using cpu_to_le16 like in the other places
  where we use definitions as arguments.

Changes in v4:
* Ensured any disassociation would only be processed if the destination
  pan ID matches ours.
* Association requests should be made using extended addressing, it's
  the specification, so ensure this is true. Doing so helps reducing the
  checks down the road.
* Updated a copyright from 2021 to 2023.
* Improved the comment for cfg802154_device_in_pan() and only accept
  extended addressing when using this internal function because there is
  no point in checking short addresses here.
* Move nl802154_prepare_wpan_dev_dump() and
  nl802154_finish_wpan_dev_dump() outside of a
  CONFIG_IEEE802154_NL802154_EXPERIMENTAL #ifdef bloc as now used in
  regular code (not only experimental).
* Added a missing return value in the kernel doc of
  cfg802154_device_is_associated().

Changes in v3:
* Clarify a helper which compares if two devices seem to be identical by
  adding two comments. This is a static function that is only used by
  the PAN management core to operate or not an
  association/disassociation request. In this helper, a new check is
  introduced to be sure we compare fields which have been populated.
* Dropped the "association_generation" counter and all its uses along
  the code. I tried to mimic some other counter but I agree it is not
  super useful and could be dropped anyway.
* Dropped a faulty sequence number hardcoded to 10. This had no impact
  because a few lines later the same entry was set to a valid value.

Changes in v2:
* Drop the misleading IEEE802154_ADDR_LONG_BROADCAST definition and its
  only use which was useless anyway.
* Clarified how devices are defined when the user requests to associate
  with a coordinator: for now only the extended address of the
  coordinator is relevant so this is the only address we care about.
* Drop a useless NULL check before a kfree() call.
* Add a check when allocating a child short address: it must be
  different than ours.
* Rebased on top of v6.5.
