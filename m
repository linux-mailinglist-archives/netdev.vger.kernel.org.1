I see. So this is what you were referencing. Arguably I can see both
sides of the issue. Ideally what should have been presented would have
been the root cause of why the diff was breaking things and then it
could have been fixed. However instead what was presented was
essentially a bisect with a request to revert.

Ultimately Eric accepted the revert since there was an issue that
needed to be fixed. However I can't tell what went on in terms of
trying to get to the root cause as that was taken offline for
discussion so I can't say what role Mellanox played in either good or
bad other than at least performing the bisect.

Ultimately I think this kind of comes down to the hobbyist versus
commercial interests issue that I brought up earlier. The hobbyist
side should at least be curious about what about the Vagrant
implementation was not RFC compliant which the changes supposedly
were, thus the interest in getting a root cause. However that said it
is broken and needs to be fixed so curiosity be damned, we cannot
break userspace or not interop with other TCP implementations.

Because I have been trying to keep the  whole discussion about the
fbnic driver that is presented in this patch set. When I was referring
to a "less than cooperative maintainer" it was in response to the
hypothetical about what if Meta started refusing to work with the
community after this was accepted, and the "Nvidia treatment" I was
referring was the graphics side about 10 years ago[1] as the question
was about somebody running to Linus to complain that their proprietary
hardware got broken by a kernel change. The general idea being if we
are a proprietary NIC with ourselves as the only customer Linus would
be more likely to give Meta a similar message.

Sorry, it wasn't meant to be any sort of attack on Nvidia/Mellanox.
The Nvidia I was referencing was the graphics side which had a bad
reputation with the community long before Mellanox got involved.

> Thanks

Thank you. I understand now that you and Jason were just trying to
warn me about what the community will and won't accept. Like I
mentioned before I had just misconstrued Jason's comments as backing
Jiri initially in this. In my mind I was prepared for the
Nvidia/Mellanox folks dog piling me so I was just prepared for
attacks.

Just for the record this will be the third NIC driver I have added to
the kernel following igbvf and fm10k, and years maintaining some of
the other Intel network drivers. So I am well aware of the
expectations of a maintainer. I might be a bit rusty due to a couple
years of being focused on this project and not being able to post as
much upstream, but as the expression goes "This isn't my first rodeo".
