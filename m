Thank you keeping the discussion going, Dust.
I know there is no perfect answer, but imo good names can make things easier to
understand.
For reasons described above, I would like to have a 'B for buffer' in the prefix.
There are many I/O concepts that share memory somehow, but the concept of a dmb dedicated to
exactly 2 devices is a differentiator, imo.
I thought 'D for device' was somehow redundant and obvious. But you now you are saying that for
you the device is a differentiator? As opposed to other memory sharing techniques that work
without devices? Maybe you have a point...

So maybe DMB - Direct Memory Buffers is a good term?
I know we use it for the buffers already, but they are actually a common aspect for all devices
and clients, right? So we could define a dmb layer with generic dmb_devices that can be used by dmb_clients
to communicate via dmb_bufs.
