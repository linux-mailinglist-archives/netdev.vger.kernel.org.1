Right, move_data() has a length field. My bad.

The existing ism implementations pass a bit mask in 'some_signal_info'
that can be used to signal which parts of the DMB have data to look at.

Yes, there can be multiple DMBs between the same two peers. And/or an
ism device can provide multiple DMBs that are shared with different peers.

More the latter. Although they can be large, if the client or
application wants to spend so much memory.

Which brings us back to the other thread, that ISM may not be the best
name for this concept. MCD - 'Memory Communication Device', was a
proposals without 'Shared' in the name...

Yes, the 'clients' are the protocols above this.

The former: putting data into the DMB.
But yes the concept of attached, no-copy DMBs, that was introduced by
ism-loopback needs a better description.

The ism_ops register_dmb() and unregister_dmb() are meant to provide
that API.
