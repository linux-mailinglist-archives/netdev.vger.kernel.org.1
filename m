I agree that there might be some corner cases which the current election 
code does not handle very well (one of them is outlined below).

This (#2) is what this patch trying to address. With DAD enabled, the 
first MLD Query is never transmitted. That essentially means that the 
Robustness Variable is 1 (which is not very robust).

Some systems could not afford to flood multicast traffic. Think of some 
resource-constrained low power sensors connected to a network with high 
volume multicast video traffic for example. The multicast traffic could 
easily choke the sensors and is essentially a DDoS attack.

I'm not sure this should be categorized as an optimization. If we never 
intend to send Startup Queries, that's a different story. But if we 
intend to send it but failed, I think that should be a bug.

This is what I meant by ":: always wins":

In br_multicast_select_querier(),

	if (ipv6_addr_cmp(&saddr->src.ip6, &querier->addr.src.ip6) <= 0)
		goto update;

If querier->addr.src.ip6 is 0, nothing can be less than that, so ":: 
always wins".

However,

1. querier->addr.src.ip6 is (un)initialized(?) to 0 (I couldn't find the 
place where ip6_querier.addr is initialized)
2. Querier election cannot take place due to the comparison above, until 
the bridge selects itself first via br_multicast_select_own_querier()
3. the bridge only selects itself after the first successful Query is 
sent to the host
4. br_ip6_multicast_alloc_query() will fail if v6 address is not valid

So, without this patch a system would have to wait for

31.25 seconds (for the second Query to the host to selects itself) +
~125 seconds (for the next Query from the real Querier to arrive)

in order to receive multicast traffic. For some embedded devices that's 
a very long time (imagine turning on a TV and have to wait for 2 minutes 
and a half before it starts working).

Thanks,
Joseph
