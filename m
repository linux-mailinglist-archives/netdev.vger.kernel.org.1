As my understanding, it is a implementation detail that API caller does
not need to care about if the API is used correctly. If not, we have bigger
problem than above.

If there is a error in that implementation, it would be good to point it
out. And there is already a comment explaining that implementation detail
in this patch, doesn't adding a explicit VM_BUG_ON() make it more obvious.

I am not sure if you get the point that getting rid of nc->encoded_va
checking in the fast path is the reason we are able able to refactor
common codes into __page_frag_cache_reload(), so that both the old API
and new APIs can reuse the common codes.

If there is no new APIs added, I guess I am agreed with your above
argument.
With the new API for new use case, the refactoring in this patch make
code more reusable and maintainable, that is why I would have preferred
not to break this patchset into more patchsets as it is already hard to
argue the reason behind the refactoring.

To be honest, I am not so obsessed with where are pagecnt_bias and
remaining set.
I am obsessed with whether the __page_frag_cache_reload() is needed.
Let's be more specific about your suggestion here: are you suggesting to
remove __page_frag_cache_reload()?
If yes, are you really expecting both old and new API duplicating the
below checking pattern? Why?

if (likely(nc->encoded_va)) {
	if (__page_frag_cache_reuse(nc->encoded_va, nc->pagecnt_bias))
		...
}

if (unlikely(remaining < fragsz)) {
	page = __page_frag_cache_refill(nc, gfp_mask);
	....
}

If no, doesn't it make sense to call __page_frag_cache_reload() for both
old and new API?

I would argue that by duplicating the above checking for both the old
and new API will make the code less maintainable, for example, when
fixing bug or making changing to the duplicated checking, it is more
likely miss to change some of them if there are duplicated checking
codes.

It would good to be more specific about what is the race here? if it does
exist, we can fix it.

And it would be good to have more specific suggestion and argument too,
othewise it just you arguing for preserving old behavior to make
the code much less prone to any sort of possible races, and me arguing
for making the old code more reusable and maintainable for the new API.
