Hello Prithvi,

I'm answering in this mail thread as you answered on the other thread 
which does not preserve the discussion above.

Yes. It solves that specific bug. But IMO we need to fix the root cause 
of this issue.

The CAN skb is passed to NAPI and XDP code

  kmalloc_reserve+0x23e/0x4a0 net/core/skbuff.c:609
  pskb_expand_head+0x226/0x1a60 net/core/skbuff.c:2275
  netif_skb_check_for_xdp net/core/dev.c:5081 [inline]
  netif_receive_generic_xdp net/core/dev.c:5112 [inline]
  do_xdp_generic+0x9e3/0x15a0 net/core/dev.c:5180
  __netif_receive_skb_core+0x25c3/0x6f10 net/core/dev.c:5524

which invoked pskb_expand_head() which manipulates skb->head and 
therefore removes the reference to our struct can_skb_priv.

Suggested-by tag?

No. Neither of that - as it will not fix the root cause.

IMO we need to check who is using the headroom in CAN skbs and for what 
reason first. And when we are not able to safely control the headroom 
for our struct can_skb_priv content we might need to find another way to 
store that content.
E.g. by creating this space behind skb->data or add new attributes to 
struct sk_buff.

Best regards,
Oliver
