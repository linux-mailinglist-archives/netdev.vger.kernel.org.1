I suspect this is where the requirement comes from in the KSZ9477
documentation - and it's been "translated" badly. I note that in the
KSZ9477 documentation, bit[0] of VR_MII_DIG_CTRL1 is marked as
"reserved" and takes the value zero, so in the case of PHY-side SGMII,
(6) always applies to KSZ9477 and (5) never does.

This also solves my concern about 2a22b7ae2fa3 ("net: pcs: xpcs: adapt
Wangxun NICs for SGMII mode"), because there (5) would apply.

Yes, agreed. Thankfully, SJA1105 sets PHY_MODE/TX_CONFIG=0 and leaves
SGMII_PHY_MODE_CTRL unaltered. TXGBE sets TX_CONFIG=1 but sets
SGMII_PHY_MODE_CTRL=1 which also avoids this requirement.

If you want to peek at the KSZ9477 documentation, what I'm looking at is
available from here:
https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ksz9477#Documentation

Interestingly, there are a number of errata:

Module 7 - SGMII auto-negotiation does not set bit 0 in the
auto-negotiation code word
Basically requires MII_ADVERTISE to be written as 0x1a0, and is only
needed after power-up or reset.

Module 8 - SGMII port link details from the connected SGMII PHY are not
passed properly to the port 7 GMAC
Basically, AUTONEG_INTR_STATUS needs to be read, and the PCS
manually programmed for the speed.

Module 15 - SGMII registers are not initialized by hardware reset
Requires that bit 15 of BASIC_CONTROL is set to reset the registers.

All three are not scheduled to be fixed, apparently.

There seems to be no information listed there regarding the requirement
for SGMII PHY mode.

(Using SJA1105 register terminology...)

Looking at the patch, Tristram is setting PHY_MODE=1 and SGMII_LINK=1
not when configuring for SGMII, but when configuring for 1000base-X.

This is reflected in the documentation for KSZ9477 - which states that
both these bits need to be set in "SerDes" aka 1000base-X mode. The
question is... where did that statement come from, and should we be
doing that for 1000base-X mode anyway?
