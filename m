I am not sure, I would probably prefer code there because it can be
easily modified to other value or make it configurable. So this
would look like

        if (dbt->bitrate > 1000000) {
                /* Calculate SSP in minimal time quanta */
                ssp_offset = (priv->can.clock.freq / 1000) * dbt->sample_point / dbt->bitrate;

                if (ssp_offset > 127) {
                        netdev_warn(ndev, "SSP offset saturated to 127\n");
                        ssp_offset = 127;
                }

                ssp_cfg = FIELD_PREP(REG_TRV_DELAY_SSP_OFFSET, ssp_offset);
                ssp_cfg |= FIELD_PREP(REG_TRV_DELAY_SSP_SRC, 0x0);
        }

It matches currents state of the driver in the IP CORE repository where
you have propagated change lat week

https://gitlab.fel.cvut.cz/canbus/ctucanfd_ip_core/-/commit/6188ca673f823873f7b37dbb588a2d4c0a0cc98c

But I would suggest to cover even else case for dbt->bitrate <= 1 Mbit/s by else
statement which should be probably 

        } else {
                ssp_cfg = FIELD_PREP(REG_TRV_DELAY_SSP_OFFSET, 0);
                ssp_cfg |= FIELD_PREP(REG_TRV_DELAY_SSP_SRC, 0x0);
        }

It is right that ctucan_set_secondary_sample_point() is called from ctucan_chip_start()
only and it is called from ctucan_do_set_mode() and ctucan_open() only and the chip
reset is done in both paths prior to ctucan_chip_start() but I think that
state should be defined there even for case that core is only stopped by
by REG_MODE_ENA and then re-enabled an no leftover from setup with higher
data bitrate to some followup change to lower one should be left there.

If there is already some defined way how to control/enable/disable
SSP from userspace for some of other drivers then I would
ted to have such option for CTU CAN FD as well to have
option to test/diagnose and correct (in the case of some problems)
its behavior without driver recompile.

I think that it is OK, we have there already option to propagate
value from PCI and OF specific CTU CAN FD mapping into base code
but it is fixed on four buffers fr now and no mapping to OF is provided.
So I would change it such that ntxbufs = 0 specified by PCI or OF
mapping would result in configuration from info register.
If the requested ntxbufs from PCI or OF is higher than value reported
by info register then it should be limited as well and final limit
should be some define

#define CTUCANFD_NTXBUFS_MAX 8

We have that tested info register reading in RTEMS driver
for 2.5 as well as older branch so I hope that risk
of breaking someone's CTU CAN FD specific integration
is relatively small.

I prepare patches. The SSP one can be considered as bugfix
if Marc, David or somebody with the need proposes that
and may it be it can get to 6.19. Or I prepare both
for the next merge window.

Best wishes,

                Pavel
