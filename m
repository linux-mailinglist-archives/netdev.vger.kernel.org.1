I know. The fact is we aren't trying to abstract away anything as that
would mean a larger firmware blob. That is the problem with an
abstraction like idpf is that it just adds more overhead as you have
to have the firmware manage more of the control plane.

The problem here in this case is that I am pretty much the heart of
the software driver team with a few new hires onboarding the next
couple months. People were asking why others were jumping to my
defense, well if we are going to judge the team they are mostly
judging me. I'm just hoping my reputation has spoken for itself
considering I was making significant contributions to the drivers even
after I have gone through several changes of employer.
