If you really want to do something else there or only act on 802.15.4
fields and you hit the limitations of netem then this is something
netem needs to be extended.

Let=E2=80=99s say I=E2=80=99m quite familiar with netem - netem is indeed w=
ell-known
and has been used extensively with tc/ifb. However, it is primarily
suited for 1-to-1 communication scenarios.
In 1-to-n topologies, such as when node 0 communicates with both node
1 and node 2, it becomes unclear which peer should serve as the
reference for applying delay, loss, or latency.
This limitation makes netem unsuitable for scenarios where
link-specific behavior is required, such as in ad hoc networks.
In such cases, a more precise per-link control - as provided by
wmediumd - becomes necessary.

> With that being said, however there are so few users of 802.15.4 in
Linux and adding your specific stuff, I might add it if this helps you
currently... but I think there are better ways to accomplish your use
cases by using existing generic infrastructure and don't add handling
for that into hwsim.

Back in 2016, mac80211_hwsim had relatively few users. Today, I
maintain a community of approximately 1,000 users worldwide who rely
on mac80211_hwsim for their research - industry and academy.
The need for a realistic experimental platform is not a personal
requirement, but rather a broader gap in the ecosystem. Addressing
this gap has the potential to significantly advance research on IEEE
802.15.4.

> but I think there are better ways to accomplish your use

Honestly, based on my experience so far, there=E2=80=99s no better approach
available. Well - there is one: integrating all the wmediumd
functionality directly into the kernel module itself. But I fully
agree - that would be both unrealistic and impractical.
