The above sentence was meant "in the common case". But here we are in a
very specific location which does not really apply to the common case.

During associations (because this is all what this is about), the stack
always saves the extended address, and when it is known, the short
address as well.

When I need these comparisons, it is because a device (parent or
children) has requested an association or a disassociation, and I want
to find the local "structure" which matches it. I looked again at the
specification, it says:
- In the case of an association request, the device will use its
  extended address only.
- In the case of a disassociation notification, the device will also
  use its extended address only and will address it to the
  coordinator using the right PAN ID. So actually, on one side, the
  "we might use the short address" never applies and on the other
  side, checking the PAN ID *here* is not relevant either as it
  should be done earlier (and the disassociation canceled if the wrong
  PAN ID is used).

So in v4 I will just error out if one uses short addressing in this
function, because it would make no sense at all. I will also check the
PAN ID in the disassociation procedure.

Thanks,
