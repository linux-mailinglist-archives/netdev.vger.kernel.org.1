Just a thought: not all clients have to use all available ism devices.
The client could opt out without removing the device.

All good points. But it also shows that there are many options how to
extend ism device handling of the upper layers / clients.
e.g. I can image a loop macro ism_for_each_dev() might be nice...
I'd prefer to take one step at a time. Start with a minimal useful ism
layer and extend by usecase.
