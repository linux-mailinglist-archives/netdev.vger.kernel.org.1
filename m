As you described - the BootROM is using those two pins as UART0.

Should you want those pins to be used as GPIOs, you'd at least get HW glitches in
early boot phases, or you'd render emergency download mode unusable - which is not
a good idea, not practical, and also, well, almost a stupid thing to do from the
hardware perspective.

This means that it is very, very, very unlikely (to the point that it's practically
impossible) that those pins can ever be used for anything else that is not *the*
one of the two functions that are supported for them (which is UART0 in this case).

In this case, adding the pins at the board level would only create unnecessary
duplication and nothing else, because, well, noone could possibly ever use those
for anything else, again.

That's the criteria.

If the BootROM didn't use those pins, and those could support both GPIO mode and
HW function mode (any: uart0, 1, 2...n, spi, i2c, whatever else), even though it
is likely for boards to use them for one specific function, there is nothing that
stops a HW engineer to decide to route those elsewhere and use them as a GPIO
instead, so that's not a SoC configuration, but rather a HW implementation decision
at the PCB level.

See it like this (although this is an oversimplified view):
  - SoC DT describes the SoC (the chip) - in this case the MT7981B chip
  - Board DT describes decisions that were taken by the HW engineer that developed
    the PCB on which the MT7981B was placed.

Clearly, if there's a board design (usually, a "base project") that has derivatives
(for example, a device with eMMC, one with UFS, one with both, one with two SFP,
one with one SFP and one soldered ethernet chip on a non-exposed SFP interface,
etc) it is ok to have a "board-common" dtsi and specific board variants on top,
like it is done with some bananapi and some genio boards.

Lots of text here - yet oversimplified. There is much more to say, but I think
(and hope) that this is enough to make you understand the main point (of course
feel free to throw more questions if what I wrote doesn't fully satisfy you).

Ewwww I'm doing too may things at once. Pretty crazy days around here :)))

Yeah. Sorry.

I repeat then, so that this is clear: you are right, the pinctrl for UART0 on the
MT7981B SoC must go to mt7981b.dtsi and *not* to mt7981b-openwrt-one.

Cheers,
Angelo
