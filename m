>>> Wouldn't you look for a pre-programmed decoder first and construct the auto region before you try to manually create one? Also for a type 2 device, would the driver know what it wants and what the region configuration should look like? Would it be a single region either it's auto or manual, or would there be a configuration of multiple regions possible? To me a type 2 region is more intentional where the driver would know exactly what it needs and thus trying to get that from the cxl core.

This patchset supports the latter, but the former is more than possible, even if the logic and what we have discussed since the RFC points to type2 driver having the full control.

The reason is clear: I do not want to delay this "basic Type2 support" more than necessary, and as I stated in another comment, I bet we will see other things to support soon, so better to increasingly add those after a first work set the base. Of course, the base needs to be right.

I'm fine with the follow on approach. We probably should make a note somewhere in a commit log somewhere that only manual assemble mode is currently supported. And need to reject the BIOS created region and exit type2 CXL setup if present?
