Hmmm, yes the generic phy driver path for this
doesn't seem to work well. Its fine and dandy if there's
no device_link (current situation), but if there is one
(say with my patch and in my example above between ethernet1 and phy@a,
you can ignore the ethernet0 relationship since its a cycle
and therefore no device_link is created as mentioned in the patch)
you run into problems with the generic phy driver.

In my original test you can see I use the marvell driver
for the phy. In that case things work well. In the generic phy
case however, ethernet1's probe is actually delayed far past
phy@a. Here's some logs that show that the device_link getting
"relaxed" due to no driver being bound, which has fw_devlink
thinking this supplier phy isn't going to get a driver ever,
so it finally tries to unblock (probe) the consumer (ethernet1):

If I understand correctly that's because the generic phy driver
is bound during a MAC's (like ethernet1 here) phylink_fwnode_phy_connect() call
in ndo_open() currently.. here's another dump_stack() (yes I abuse that alot)
showing when that happens:

Something will need to be done for the generic phy driver case before
this patch could be considered acceptable as this would slow the boot time
for the topology I described in the patch description if the generic phy
driver was used.
