I don't want to come across as snarky, but you must be new to Intel?
If nothing else you might ask a few people there  about the history of
the fm10k drivers. I think I did most of the Linux and FreeBSD fm10k
drivers in about 2 to 3 years. Typically getting basic Tx and Rx up
and running on a driver only takes a few weeks, and it is pretty
straight forward when you are implementing the QEMU at the same time
to test it on. From my experience driver development really goes by
the pareto principle where getting basic Tx/Rx up and running is
usually a quick task. What takes forever is enabling all the other
offloads and functions.

As far as this driver goes I would say this is something similar, only
this time I have worked on a Linux and UEFI driver, both of which I am
hoping to get upstreamed. With that said I can go through the bits for
the yet to be upstreamed parts that weren't done by me.

We had tried to bring a few people onto the team early on, none of
which are with the team anymore but a couple are still with the
company so I can reach out to them and see if they are okay with the
Co-autthor attribution before I submit those patches. I have a few
people who worked on the ptp and debugfs, one that enabled Tx offloads
and the ethtool ring configuration, and another had just started work
on the UEFI driver before he left. In addition there was an Intern who
did most of the work on the ethtool loopback test.

When the layoffs hit in late 2022 the team was basically reduced to
just myself and a firmware developer. Neither of us really strayed too
much into the other's code. Basically I defined the mailbox interface
and messages and went on our separate ways from there. In the last 6
months our team started hiring again. The new hires are currently
working in areas that aren't in this set such as devlink firmware
update, ethtool register dump, and various other interactions with the
firmware.
