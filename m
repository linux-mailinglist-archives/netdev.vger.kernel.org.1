Which in-kernel driver use this information?

It is intentional, because the packet is forwarded to HW as plain text
and it is not offloaded (doesn't have xfrm_offload()).

You are trying to make same flow as for crypto, but it is not the same,
in crypto case secpath_reset() was called to release SKB extensions and
perform cleanup, first and only after that new xfrm_state_hold() was
called, but in new code SKB is not reset.
