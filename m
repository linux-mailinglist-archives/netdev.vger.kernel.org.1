Thank you guys for the detail explaination on s390! I throught it was
like normal PCI device. @Niklas, @Alexandra, @Julian

Agree.

For SMC, it already handles zero-copy and copy modes differently. In
copy mode, the current API seems appropriate, but for zero-copy mode, we
may need to extend it.

Taking the loopback device as an example, SMC requires the move_data()
function to copy the CDC into the DMB. However, copying the data from
the source to the destination DMB is not necessary. Instead, it needs to
signal the peer that the data transfer is complete, so an API for
notification is required.

One solution might be to retain the move_data() function and introduce
something like a notify() API. Alternatively, if we don't want to extend
the API, we could use something like move_data(ismdev, data=NULL,
length=0, ..., signal=1).

I'm not opposed to that.

For the shared DMB, I now agree with you. Perhaps we can keep the
move_data() behavior consistent with memcpy(3) or memmove(3) and leave
the usage to the upper layer.
