Somehow, I fail to see how this answer addresses what I said.

When writing a new device driver, you have to think about FDB isolation.
At the most basic level, that can be achieved by not reusing the same
VLAN across multiple forwarding domains where MAC address namespace
collisions might exist. That is all.

There are things I don't understand in what you're trying to transmit,
such as:
- "I might place a PVID here anyway" - do you have the option of _not_
having a default port PVID, for when the port is standalone? I don't
understand the optionality of "I might".
- "my mv88e6352 device (...) learns MAC addresses in VID 4095 when egress
is untagged" - actually it learns in MV88E6XXX_VID_BRIDGED when under a
VLAN-unaware bridge, not when "egress is untagged".

but I strongly suggest taking a look at the selftests before you follow
up to this part again.

Some of the API functions like regmap_update_bits_base() or
phy_modify_changed() have a way of telling the caller whether there was
any change in the original value or not. Maybe you can draw some
inspiration from them.

Yes, and yt921x_pvid_set() is not called from yt921x_vlan_filtering().
Have a look at Documentation/networking/switchdev.rst section, it
explains that the PVID configured by the bridge should only take effect
if the port is currently VLAN-aware, which is a state that
yt921x_vlan_filtering() changes. If the hardware PVID remains the same
when the port is VLAN-aware and VLAN-unaware, there is probably a bug
somewhere.

In theory, it's adding VLANs as long as struct switchdev_obj_port_vlan :: changed
is false. Though, because switchdev_obj_port_vlan objects are added from
two sources (switchdev and .ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid()), there might still be
bugs which allow a switchdev VLAN to change an .ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid()
VLAN and not set the "changed" flag, or vice versa. Those would be just
bugs that need to be better sealed, though, since the goal is to not
permit multiple sources from adding the same VLAN ID to a port. One
would need to delete the first before adding the second.

This is just for your general information. I am wondering when will your
logic of tracking the number of VLAN IDs, and setting YT921X_PORT_VLAN_CTRL1_CVLAN_DROP_TAGGED,
make a difference? If there is no VLAN ID configured and the port is
VLAN-aware, won't the port drop all tagged packets without this flag set?
It seems extra complexity with no clear benefit.

I think we're talking past each other, and my previous comment wasn't
expressed in the clearest way.

You have to decide what pp->pvid means - whether it tracks only the PVID
from the bridge layer (as it currently does), or the PVID which the port
is programmed with, and which will have a different value from the
above, in the situations that the port is standalone or under a bridge
that is currently VLAN-unaware.

The bridge layer indeed will not attempt to add VID 0 or VID 4095, so
you could use any of these values as an indication that the port has no
bridge PVID (and should drop untagged and VID0-tagged packets). You are
currently using pp->pvid == 0 as an indication of "no bridge PVID", and
that is functionally fine.

I suggested that you rename pp->pvid to pp->vlan_aware_pvid, in order to
make it clearer that the two uses of the number 0 are different. It is
valid for the hardware PVID programmed to YT921X_PORT_VLAN_CTRL_CVID to
be 0, and it is valid for the bridge VLAN-aware PVID to be absent, but
the two are absolutely independent and separate conditions.

Whereas you are responding to this comment by saying (rephrased) "to
solve the inconsistency, I can program YT921X_PORT_VLAN_CTRL_CVID to 0
and that shouldn't have any consequences", but this further blurs the
line between the two PVID concepts instead of separating them.

I don't believe that when the bridge PVID gets deleted and the port is
VLAN-aware, the port should be reconfigured to YT921X_PVID_DEFAULT.
It should be sufficient that YT921X_PORT_VLAN_CTRL1_CVLAN_DROP_UNTAGGED
gets set - the hardware PVID in this case can be whatever it may.

Perhaps for you it's clear, but for me it still isn't. If, as you say,
DSA always expects the CPU port to be in the forwarding mask, then what
decision is left in the caller's responsibility? To do what it has to do?

It would be, for me, much clearer to express what you just said as:
"The caller must make sure that the CPU port is part of the ports_mask".

Still not the best practice, but ok.

Did you understand what I said? It doesn't look like it, or I don't
understand in which way what you said is related to it.

In yt921x_bridge_force(), targets_mask holds the user ports which are
not part of this bridge (all of them). You force them all as standalone.

But in the example I gave with two bridges, you are configuring the
ports of br0 as standalone, when an unrelated port leaves br1. According
to my understanding of the code, that isolates the ports of br0 from
each other, which is not what the user has asked for.

Ok, I had other hardware in mind, where ageing_time==0 was a special
value for "never age".

What Andrew said. If you need the internal MDIO bus, you describe it in
the device tree.

Ok, I expect yt921x_dsa_port_vlan_fast_age() will be removed from next

When I said "higher level debugging interfaces", I had in mind "higher
level" in the sense Andrew mentioned - devlink regions, etc for
functional areas of interest that the developer has foreseen - and not
"lower level" like MDIO bus level access, which is even worse than the
sysfs due to the non-atomic accesses that you mention.

I see no problem with people who want to debug building their own
modified kernel with extra yt921x_smi_read() and yt921x_smi_write()
calls for the register of interest. That's pretty far from "anybody who
wants to debug has to have the sysfs".
