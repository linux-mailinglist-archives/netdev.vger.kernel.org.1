By "less than cooperative maintainer" I was referring to the scenario
where somebody is maintaining something unique to them, such as the
Meta Host NIC, and not willing to work with the community to fix it
and instead just demanding a revert of a change. It doesn't seem like
it would be too much to ask to work with the author on a fix for the
problem as long as the maintainer is willing to work with the author
on putting together and testing the fix.

With that said if the upstream version of things aren't broken then it
doesn't matter. It shouldn't be expected of the community to maintain
any proprietary code that wasn't accepted upstream.

Any more info on this? Without context it is hard to say one way or the oth=
er.

I know I have seen my fair share of hot issues such as when the
introduction of the tracing framework was corrupting the NVRAM on
e1000e NICs.[1] It got everyone's attention when it essentially
bricked one of Linus's systems. I don't recall us doing a full revert
on function tracing as a result, but I believe it was flagged as
broken until it could be resolved. So depending on the situation there
are cases where asking for a fix or revert might be appropriate.

Okay, but that doesn't tie into what is going on here. In this case
"vendor" =3D=3D "user". Like I was saying the community generally cares
about the user so 3 would be the important case assuming they are
using a stock kernel and driver and not hiding behind the vendor
expecting some sort of proprietary fix. If they are using some
proprietary stuff behind the scenes, then tough luck.

I didn't say you couldn't. Without context I cannot say if it was
deserved or not. I know in the example I cited above Intel had to add
changes to the e1000e driver to make the NVRAM non-writable until the
problem patch was found. So Intel was having to patch to fix an issue
it didn't introduce and deal with the negative press and blow-back
from a function tracing patch that was damaging NICs.

The point I was trying to make is that if you are the only owner of
something, and not willing to work with the community as a maintainer
it becomes much easier for the community to just revert the driver
rather than try to change the code if you aren't willing to work with
them. Thus the "less than cooperative" part. The argument being made
seems to be that once something is in the kernel it is forever and if
we get it in and then refuse to work with the community it couldn't be
reverted. I am arguing that isn't the case, especially if Meta were to
become a "less than cooperative maintainer" for a device that is
primarily only going to be available in Meta data centers.

Thanks,
