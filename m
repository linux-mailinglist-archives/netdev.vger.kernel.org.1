QEMU computes the DMA logging ranges for two predefined ranges: 32-bit
and 64-bit. In the OVMF case, QEMU includes in the 64-bit range, RAM
(at the lower part) and device RAM regions (at the top of the address
space). The size of that range can be bigger than the 2^42 limit of
the MLX5 HW for dirty tracking. QEMU is not making much effort to be
smart. There is room for improvement.

We can not exclude the device RAM regions since we don't know what
the HW could do with them. Correct me here. But we can certainly
avoid the huge gap in the 64-bit range by adding support for more
than 2 ranges in QEMU.

Then, if the overall size exceeds what HW supports, the vfio-pci
variant driver will report an error, as of today.

Thanks,

C.
