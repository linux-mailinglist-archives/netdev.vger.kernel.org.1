Hi, Paolo, I conducted some experiments on your concern by reverting e994=
b2f0fb92 on version 4.19 to observe how TCP handles this race condition.

Here are the observations:
where SYN-A is processed on CPUA and SYN-B is processed on CPUB

CPUA & CPUB

In tcp_v4_rcv(), both SYN-A and SYN-B obtained the same sk from __inet_lo=
okup_listener(), with the sk state being TCP_LISTEN.

 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0CPUA

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 SYN-A acquired sk_lock and was processed in tcp_v4_do=
_rcv(), where it created reqsk-A while in TCP_LISTEN state and sent a SYN=
ACK packet.

    =20

 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 CPUB

 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 After SYN-A was processed and sk_lock was released, SYN-B was process=
ed. Since it was the same sk still in TCP_LISTEN state, it created reqsk-=
B and sent a SYNACK packet with a different seq number.

The issue remains reproducible.

BRs!
