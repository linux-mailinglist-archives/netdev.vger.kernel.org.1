IDK, why so many people in this thread are so focused on "buying" nic.
IDPF device is something I assume one may see on a VM hosted in some
cloud, isn't it? If yes, it is completely legit to have it in. Do I miss
something?

So bottom line is, the unused driver *may* introduce some features and
*may* provide as an example of how to do things for other people.
Is this really that beneficial for the community that it overweights
the obvious cons (not going to repeat them)?

Like with any other patch/set we merge in, we always look at the cons
and pros. I'm honestly surprised that so many people here
want to make exception for Meta's internal toy project.

Again with "buying", uff.
