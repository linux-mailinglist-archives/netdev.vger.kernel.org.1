The AR8031 has two hardware pins for signalling WoL. One of them is the
main INT pin, which is controlled by register 0x12 bit 0. This is an
interrupt enable bit, and it only affects the INT pin.

The second is the WOL_INT pin, which is _not_ controlled by register
0x12 bit 0. This can only be controlled via the AT803X_WOL_EN in the
1588 register.

You have moved the control of AT803X_WOL_EN before the setup of the MAC,
setting and clearing it before calling the other function. This means
that if the MAC is invalid, AT803X_WOL_EN can be set, but the MAC
address has not been programmed, which can leave the machine vulnerable
to spurious wakeups if the WOL_INT pin is used for that purpose.

The original code gets the order correct. Your replacement code breaks
this ordering, thus making it less correct.

Given how big the series already is, you're in danger of going over the
15 patch limit for netdev submissions, so I think careful thought on
that would be needed (e.g. possibly splitting this series.) Wait until
Andrew has also reviewed the series before you decide on that though.
