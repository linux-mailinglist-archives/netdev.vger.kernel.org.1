The main, but not the only, motivation for stateless systems is explained in

https://clearlinux.org/features/stateless
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/StatelessLinux
https://summit.debconf.org/debconf15/meeting/276/stateless-cloud-friendly-debian/

In a nutshell: to better support factory resets, shared read-only base 
systems, containers & Co, all software should work even without /etc.

A nice side effect of adopting stateless-style configuration (read from 
/etc, fallback to /usr) is that it allows for distro-provided files to 
be strictly read-only, avoiding a bunch of common failures during 
updates and upgrades (Debian spends a huge amount of resources to 
correctly handle these so called "conffiles". The fewer, the better.)

> Is /etc going away in some future version of systemd?
This is unrelated to systemd, although systemd is probably the most well 
known software that uses this pattern.

Build-time or run-time env variable?

I'd say that run-time env variables (a lÃ  XDG Base Directory) are kind 
of hard to deal with in a command like `ip` that is often invoked via 
`sudo` (that filters and changes env in complex ways).

BTW, I strongly suggest to just go with this common pattern that is now 
known to all sysadmins instead of inventing an ad-hoc way to move the 
default configuration away from /etc.

Thanks. :)
