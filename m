Hi, Wenjia.

Following Guangguan's questions, I noticed that in SMCv2, ini->smcrv2.saddr stores clcsock->sk->sk_rcv_saddr
and ini->smcrv2.daddr stores the IP converted from peer RNIC's gid (smc_ib_gid_to_ipv4(smc_v2_ext->roce)),
e.g. in smc_find_rdma_v2_device_serv(). And this is also how src address and dst address are considered in many
other places, such as in smc_ib_find_route() mentioned above. I am confused why such 'asymmetrical' usage?

    * clc src addr <----> clc dst addr
    local RNIC gid <----> * peer RNIC gid          (*) means used for saddr or daddr

I guess there might be some reason behind this and I'd really appreciate if you have a answer.

Thank you!
