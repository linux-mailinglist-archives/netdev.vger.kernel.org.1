I see.  Stewart tested hsiphash and observed more overhead as
noted in the changelog, but let me give another shot to SipHash
and HSiphash.

I'll report back here next week.

Agree.

At a glance, only rds_conn_bucket() seems a little bit tricky
as it uses v4 hash function later.

But I'll take a deeper look.

Thanks!
