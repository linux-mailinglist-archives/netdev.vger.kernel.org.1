Opensourcing is just one push to github.
There are guarantees we give to upstream drivers.

The flip side of the argument is, what if we allow some device we don't
have access to to make changes to the core for its benefit. Owner
reports that some changes broke the kernel for them. Kernel rules,
regression, we have to revert. This is not a hypothetical, "less than
cooperative users" demanding reverts, and "reporting us to Linus"
is a reality :(

Technical solution? Maybe if it's not a public device regression rules
don't apply? Seems fairly reasonable.

GenAI world, pictures mean nothing :) We do have a CI in netdev, which
is all ready to ingest external results, and a (currently tiny amount?)
of test for NICs. Prove that you care about the device by running the
upstream tests and reporting results? Seems fairly reasonable.

I'd strongly prefer if we detach our trust and respect for Alex
from whatever precedent we make here. I can't stress this enough.
IDK if I'm exaggerating or it's hard to appreciate the challenges 
of maintainership without living it, but I really don't like being
accused of playing favorites or big companies buying their way in :(

"Whatever syzbot finds" may be slightly moot for a private device ;)
but otherwise 100%! These are exactly the kind of points I think we
should enumerate. I started writing a list of expectations a while back:

Documentation/maintainer/feature-and-driver-maintainers.rst

I think we just need something like this, maybe just a step up, for
non-public devices..
