The linked-request thing feeds nicely into networking.  In fact
that's where I got the idea of linking them from.  In networking
a large GSO (currently limited to 64K but theoretically we could
make it unlimited) packet is automatically split up into a linked
list of MTU-sized skb's.

Therefore if we switched to a linked-list API networking could
give us the buffers with minimal changes.

BTW, I found an old Intel paper that claims through their multi-
buffer strategy they were able to make AES-CBC-XCBC beat AES-GCM.
I wonder if we could still replicate this today:

I totally understand that this is your priority.  But please give
me some time to see if we can devise something that works for both
scenarios.

Thanks,
