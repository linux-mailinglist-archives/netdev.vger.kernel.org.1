After looking into the code as well and trying to fix as much as
possible:

I think m_can_start() can't race with any of these. The interrupts
(incl. active_interrupts) are set before the interrupts in general are
enabled. So neither normal interrupts or hrtimer should be able to
interfere as they are started/enabled afterwards.

m_can_poll() shouldn't be able to race with the interrupt handler
either. The interrupt handler disable interrupts and schedules
m_can_poll() afterwards. Coalescing is not active when m_can_poll is
being used. So the option to set coalescing should be removed, but it
wasn't yet.

Maybe m_can_stop() may be able to interfere with the interrupt handler,
I am not sure right now. I *think* if there is any interference it
should be able to recover as m_can_start() basically resets the
interrupts. I may add a reset of active_interrupts here to make sure.

> - irqstatus is written from the ISR (or hrtimer callback) and read from m_can_poll() (NAPI callback)

Yes, also interrupts are disabled in ISR before napi is scheduled and
the interrupts are enabled by m_can_poll afterwards. So while m_can_poll
is running, I think it shouldn't be possible to have another write to
irqstatus.


Also I fixed the hrtimer issues by removing any hrtimer cancellations
for instances without IRQ. For coalescing hrtimer cancellations are safe
as the hrtimer for coalescing only triggers the irq thread.

Also found a few other bugs I fixed. I will send a series with fixes
soon.

Best,
Markus
