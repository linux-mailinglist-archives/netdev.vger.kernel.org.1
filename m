Why do you talk about different behaviour? Nobody suggested that. I have
no idea what you mean by "blockfilter".

Sure, you can have "blockmirredredirect" that would only to the
redirection for block target. No problem. I don't see why it can't be
just a case of mirred redirect, but if people want that separate, why
not.

My problem with the action "blockcast" is that it somehow works with
configuration of an entity the filter is attached to:
blockX->filterY->blockcastZ

Z goes all the way down to blockX to figure out where to redirect the
packet. If that is not odd, then I don't know what else is.

Has other consequences, like what happens if the filter is not attached
to block, but dev directly? What happens is blockcast action is shared
among filter? Etc.

Configuration should be action property. That is my point.
