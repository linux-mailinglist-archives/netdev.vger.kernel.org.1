I am amazed and not in a good way at how far this has gone, truly.

This really is akin to saying that any non-zero driver count to maintain 
is a burden on the community. Which is true, by definition, but if the 
goal was to build something for no users, then clearly this is the wrong 
place to be in, or too late. The systems with no users are the best to 
maintain, that is for sure.

If the practical concern is wen you make tree wide API change that fbnic 
happens to use, and you have yet another driver (fbnic) to convert, so 
what? Work with Alex ahead of time, get his driver to be modified, post 
the patch series. Even if Alex happens to move on and stop being 
responsible and there is no maintainer, so what? Give the driver a 
depreciation window for someone to step in, rip it, end of story. 
Nothing new, so what has specifically changed as of April 4th 2024 to 
oppose such strong rejection?

Like it was said, there are tons of drivers in the Linux kernel that 
have a single user, this one might have a few more than a single one, 
that should be good enough.

What the heck is going on?
