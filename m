This is a known side effect of disabling ASPM L1 per default.
There isn't really something broken, the system just consumes some more
power. If this is an issue for you and ASPM L1 causes no issues on your
system, you can use sysfs to enable ASPM L1.

The general issue is that there are at least hundreds of combinations of
RTL8168 NICs, host chipsets, and BIOS versions. Several of these combinations
cause serious issues if ASPM L1 is enabled. It's just unknown which ones,
and why. Therefore ASPM L1 is disabled per default.

Propose a patch which fixes your power consumption issue and is guaranteed
not to have negative impact on any other user.
