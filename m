Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker. Top-posting
for once, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

FWIW, I'm dropping this from the list of tracked regressions now. This
wasn't handled as it IMHO should be, but whatever, at this point it
afaics is best to leave things as they are, unless more reports of this
kind show up.

Thx everyone.

#regzbot inconclusive: not fixed, but fixing likely would cause more
trouble than it's worth, unless more people complain

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

If I did something stupid, please tell me, as explained on that page.
