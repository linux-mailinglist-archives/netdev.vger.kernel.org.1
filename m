Okay, it's reasonable and I'll do in v2.

It's okay to only deassert the bit before MDIO bus scan and after
resuming from D3hot, and I'll change to so it in v2.

Honestly saying, I don't have an accurate answer. Vendor driver's WoL
functionality doesn't work for me, thus I don't have the environment to
test the hardware behavior.

The vendor driver requires both the PHY and MAC to be online for WoL,
and configures the remote wake-up packet filter integrated in MAC. The
standalone YT8531S PHY does have a dedeciated interrupt line and could
be configured to detect magic packets as well, but I'm not sure whether
interrupt of the one integrated in YT6801 is correctly routed.

Agree, and the WoL scheme implemented in vendor driver does require the
PHY to keep working during suspension. A possible explanation for the
automatically-asserted reset is that it's asserted when the controller
is brought out of suspended D3hot state, but not when entering it, so
the PHY just keeps working until the system is resumed. Still I don't
have a working WoL environment to confirm the guess.

Thanks, I could work on WoL support later when I have more time to dig
the controller further.

Yes, I think it should be possible, as described in the datasheet of
DesignWare Ethernet Quality-of-Service Controller IP[1],

The MDIO interface is described as "optional". I don't have access to
the IP's userbook or code, so couldn't confirm it.

Most glue drivers are for SoC-integrated IPs, for which
stmmac_pltfr_probe() helper could be used to retrieve configuration
arguments from devicetree to fill plat_stmmacenet_data. However, YT6801
is a PCIe-based controller, and we couldn't rely on devicetree to carry
these parameters.

You could find similar parameter setup code in stmmac_pltfr_probe(), and
also other glue drivers for PCIe-based controllers, like dwmac-intel.c
(intel_mgbe_common_data) and dwmac-loongson.c (loongson_default_data).
