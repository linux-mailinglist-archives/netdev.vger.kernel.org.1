Florian gave links to the context, so I'll skip this part.

In this thread, Jakub tried to revive the discussion about it.

Like Jakub, I don't understand why you are talking about regressions in
the driver, while you brought the label of "less than cooperative maintainer"
and asked for "then give Meta the Nvidia treatment".

I don't want to get into the discussion about if this driver should be
accepted or not.

I'm just asking to stop label people and companies based on descriptions
from other people, but rely on facts.

Thanks
