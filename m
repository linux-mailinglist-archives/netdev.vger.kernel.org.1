So, when a Linux network driver probes, it starts out in administrative
state *DOWN*. When the administrator configures the network driver,
.ndo_open is called, which is expected to configure the network adapter.

Part of that process is to call phylink_start() as one of the last
steps, which detects whether the link is up or not. If the link is up,
then phylink will call netif_carrier_on() and .mac_link_up(). This
tells the core networking layers that the network interface is now
ready to start sending packets, and it will begin queueing packets for
the network driver to process - not before.

Prior to .ndo_open being called, the networking layers do not expect
traffic from the network device no matter what physical state the
media link is in. If .ndo_open fails, the same applies - no traffic is
expected to be passed to the core network layers from the network
layers because as far as the network stack is concerned, the interface
is still administratively down.

Thus, the fact that your BMC thinks that the link is up is irrelevant.

So, start off in a state that packet activity is suspended even if the
link is up at probe time. Only start packet activity (reception and
transmission) once .mac_link_up() has been called. Stop that activity
when .mac_link_down() is subsequently called.

There have been lots of NICs out there where the physical link doesn't
follow the adminstrative state of the network interface. This is not a
problem. It may be desirable that it does, but a desire is not the same
as "it must".

Sorry, but no.

So don't force the link, just stop packet activity. As stated above,
nothing requires that the physical link is forced down just because
.mac_link_down() has been called.

This makes me wonder what happens to your BMC with your ideas if
userspace takes down the network interface. It sounds like all hell
breaks loose because you've taken the link down, and that's seen as
a critical failure... So taking down a network interface becomes a
critical failure - yet it's a *normal* userspace operation.
