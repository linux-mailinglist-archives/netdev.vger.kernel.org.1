What is central to ISM is the DMB (Direct Memory Buffer). The concept
that there is a DMB dedicated to one writer and one reader. It is owned
by the reader and only this writer can write at any offset into the DMB
(Fabric controlled). (Reader can technically read/write as well).

So for the client API I think the core functions are
- move_data(*data, target_dmb_token, offset) - called by the sending
client, to move data at some offset into a DMB.
- receive_signal(dmb_token, some_signal_info) - called by the ism layer
to signal the client, that this DMB needs handling. (currently called
handle_irq)

I would not want to abstract that to a message based API, because then
we need queues etc and are almost at a net_device. All that is not
needed for ism, because DMBs are dedicated to a single writer (who has
the responsibility).

See my reply on 4/7, as well as Niklas' reply. Currently you can always
re-use the send buffer. So zero-copy can be a property of the DMB
(attach() function, etc. )
