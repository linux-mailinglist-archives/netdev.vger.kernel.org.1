Hi Alexandra,

I understand your concern, the maintainability is of course the most 
important. But if we use different
sock types for IPPROTO_SMC and AF_SMC, it would actually be detrimental 
to maintenance because
we have to use a judgment of which type of sock is to use in all the 
code of smc, it's really dirty.

In fact, because a sock is either given to IPPROTO_SMC as inet_sock or 
to AF_SMC as smc_sock,
it cannot exist the same time.  So it's hard to say what risks there are.

Of course, I have to say that this may not be that clean, but compared 
to adding a type judgment
for every sock usage, it is already a very clean approach.

Best wishes,
D. Wythe
