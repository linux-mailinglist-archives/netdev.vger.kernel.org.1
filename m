Are there? Do we have them documented somewhere?

This is a hypothetical. This driver currently isn't changing anything
outside of itself. At this point the driver would only be build tested
by everyone else. They could just not include it in their Kconfig and
then out-of-sight, out-of-mind.

That seems like an opportunity to be exploited through. Are the
results going to be verified in any way? Maybe cryptographically
signed? Seems like it would be easy enough to fake the results.

Again, I would say we look at the blast radius. That is how we should
be measuring any change. At this point the driver is self contained
into /drivers/net/ethernet/meta/fbnic/. It isn't exporting anything
outside that directory, and it can be switched off via Kconfig.

When the time comes to start adding new features we can probably start
by looking at how to add either generic offloads like was done for
GSO, CSO, ect or how it can also be implemented on another vendor's
NIC.

At this point the only risk the driver presents is that it is yet
another driver, done in the same style I did the other Intel drivers,
and so any kernel API changes will end up needing to be applied to it
just like the other drivers.

I honestly think we are getting the cart ahead of the horse. When we
start talking about kernel API changes then we can probably get into
the whole "private" versus "publicly available" argument. A good
example of the kind of thing I am thinking of is GSO partial where I
ended up with Mellanox and Intel sending me 40G and 100G NICs and
cables to implement it on their devices as all I had was essentially
igb and ixgbe based NICs.

Odds are when we start getting to those kind of things maybe we need
to look at having a few systems available for developer use, but until
then I am not sure it makes sense to focus on if the device is
publicly available or not.
